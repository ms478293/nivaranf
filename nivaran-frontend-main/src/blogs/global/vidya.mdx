        Student Enrollment and Completion Rates:
      </b>{" "}
      Measuring education access and retention, these metrics track the number
      of students enrolling in our programs and their ability to successfully
      complete them. A high completion rate (95%) ensures students are
      benefiting from the curriculum, while enrolling 5 million students by 2033
      reflects our commitment to making education accessible at scale. These
      indicators also help evaluate any barriers students may face and guide
      interventions to enhance student support.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b className="text-primary-main">Digital Literacy Rates:</b> In an
      increasingly technology-driven world, digital literacy is a critical skill
      for success. This KPI monitors students' proficiency in using digital
      tools, including AI-powered learning systems, coding platforms, and STEM
      resources. By ensuring digital competence, we empower learners with the
      necessary skills to excel in the modern workforce. Regular assessments and
      feedback loops will help refine teaching methods and identify gaps in
      digital literacy development.
    </p>

  <BlogParagraph>
    <b className="text-primary-main">Teacher Training Success:</b> The
    effectiveness of professional development programs is essential for quality
    education. Training 20,000 educators globally not only enhances teaching
    methodologies but also ensures sustained improvements in learning outcomes.
    This KPI measures teacher retention (90%), engagement levels, and the impact
    of training programs, including the 100+ hours of annual training per
    educator. Through ongoing evaluation and mentorship, we aim to create a
    well-supported and highly skilled teaching community.
