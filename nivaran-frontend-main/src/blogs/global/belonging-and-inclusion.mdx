## In Nepal, your caste, your gender, and how far you live from a road can determine whether you ever see a doctor. We are working to change that.

  <BlogParagraph>
    <p>
      Nepal is one of the most geographically and socially stratified
      countries in South Asia. In the far-western districts of Karnali
      and Sudurpaschim provinces, communities may be several days' walk
      from the nearest health post. Women in these areas often give
      birth without any medical supervision. Children from Dalit and
      Janajati families face systemic barriers to education. Elderly
      residents with chronic conditions go years without a checkup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nivaran Foundation does not operate with a one-size-fits-all
      model. Our health camps and education programs are specifically
      designed to reach the people who fall through the cracks of
      Nepal's existing systems.
    </p>
    <h2>Healthcare That Goes Where the Need Is</h2>
    <p>
      Our 304 health camps under Project Sanjeevani are not placed in
      district headquarters or along major highways. They are deployed
      in rural municipalities, the administrative units that contain
      Nepal's most isolated populations. Across 52 districts and 252
      municipalities, our 24 medical teams bring eye care, dental
      services, ENT treatment, general medicine, and lab testing
      directly to communities that have no other access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp sites are selected based on population data, distance from
      existing health facilities, and input from local government
      partners. We prioritize areas with the highest unmet need,
      particularly in Karnali Province (41 camps planned), Sudurpaschim
      Province (35 camps), and the hill districts of Gandaki (54 camps),
      Bagmati (59 camps), and Koshi (86 camps).
    </p>
    <h2>Gender-Inclusive Healthcare Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      In many rural Nepali communities, women face cultural barriers to
      seeking medical care. They may need permission from family members
      to travel, or feel uncomfortable being examined by male
      practitioners. Our health camps address this directly:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We include female healthcare workers on every team to ensure
        women and girls feel safe accessing services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Camp schedules include dedicated time blocks for women's health
        screenings, allowing private consultations without the pressure
        of mixed-gender waiting areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Community health workers, many of them local women, conduct
        door-to-door outreach before each camp to encourage attendance
        among women who might otherwise stay home.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When a woman in a remote village receives an eye exam, a dental
      checkup, and a blood pressure screening in a single visit, that is
      not just healthcare. It is a statement that her health matters as
      much as anyone's.
    </p>
    <h2>Education for Girls and Underserved Students</h2>
    <p>
      Project Vidya, our education initiative, focuses on removing the
      barriers that prevent children, especially girls and students from
      marginalized backgrounds, from staying in school. In Nepal's rural
      districts, girls' enrollment drops sharply after primary school due
      to poverty, early marriage, and lack of facilities like separate
      toilets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Scholarships</b> targeted at girls and students from
        economically disadvantaged families, covering school fees,
        uniforms, and supplies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Teacher training</b> that equips educators with inclusive
        teaching methods, technology-integrated instruction, and
        awareness of the specific challenges rural students face.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>School infrastructure improvements</b> including sanitation
        facilities, classroom upgrades, and learning materials that make
        schools safer and more welcoming for all students.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Culturally Sensitive by Design</h2>
    <p>
      Nepal is home to over 125 ethnic groups and 123 languages. Effective
      healthcare and education in this context requires cultural
      competence, not just clinical competence. Our teams work with local
      leaders and community health volunteers to understand local customs,
      language needs, and social dynamics before setting up camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Indigenous and Janajati communities, we coordinate with
      traditional community structures to build trust and ensure
      participation. In areas with low literacy, our health education
      materials use visual aids and are delivered in local languages.
      This is not a generic outreach strategy. It is built around the
      specific people we are trying to serve.
    </p>
    <h2>Inclusion as an Operating Principle</h2>
    <p>
      We do not treat inclusion as a separate initiative or a box to
      check. It is embedded in how we select camp locations, how we
      staff our teams, how we design our education programs, and how we
      measure success. If a health camp serves a community but misses
      the women, the elderly, or the lowest-caste families, we have not
      done our job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every patient count we report is disaggregated by gender and age.
      Every education program tracks enrollment and completion rates
      among girls and disadvantaged students. This data holds us
      accountable to the people who need us most.
