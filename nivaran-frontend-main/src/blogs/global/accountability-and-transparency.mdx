    <p>
      When you donate to the Nivaran Foundation, you are trusting us with
      resources that carry real weight. We take that trust seriously. As a
      registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit (EIN: 99-3919025), we hold ourselves to
      the highest standards of financial accountability, and we make it easy
      for anyone to verify our status and track how funds are used.
    </p>
    <h2>Verify Us Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      We encourage every donor and prospective supporter to independently
      confirm our legitimacy before giving. You can verify our tax-exempt
      status directly through the{" "}
      <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        IRS Tax Exempt Organization Search
      </a>{" "}
      using our EIN: <b>99-3919025</b>. We are a federally recognized
      501(c)(3) organization, which means your donations are tax-deductible
      to the fullest extent allowed by law.
    </p>
    <h2>Where Your Money Goes: A Transparent Breakdown</h2>
    <p>
      We allocate funds with a clear priority: maximizing direct impact on
      the ground in Nepal. Here is exactly how every dollar is distributed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>85% to Programs:</b> The vast majority of every dollar funds
        healthcare delivery through Project Sanjeevani and education
        initiatives through Project Vidya. This covers medical teams,
        supplies, camp logistics, teacher training, and school
        infrastructure across 52 districts in Nepal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>10% to Administration:</b> Lean operational costs that keep
        our teams coordinated between our Boston, Massachusetts headquarters and
        our Kathmandu office.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>5% to Fundraising:</b> A minimal investment in outreach that
        allows us to grow our donor base and sustain long-term programs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For context, the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance
      recommends that nonprofits spend at least 65% on program activities.
      At 85%, we exceed that benchmark significantly.
    </p>
    <h2>Real Numbers, Real Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Accountability is not just about how we handle money. It is about
      demonstrating measurable outcomes. Under Phase I of Project
      Sanjeevani, we are executing 304 health camps across 5 provinces,
      targeting 61,200 patients with an $18 million budget. Our 24
      technical medical teams deliver eye care, dental services, ENT
      treatment, general medicine, and lab testing to communities that
      have never had access to these services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every camp generates detailed records: the number of patients
      screened, diagnoses made, treatments provided, and referrals issued.
      This data feeds into our quarterly impact reports, which we share
      with donors and publish on our website.
    </p>
    <h2>How We Report Back to You</h2>
    <p>
      Transparency is a practice, not a slogan. Here is what we commit to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Annual Financial Reports:</b> Published each fiscal year with
        full revenue and expenditure breakdowns, available on our website.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Quarterly Impact Updates:</b> Detailed progress reports on
        active health camps and education programs, including patient
        counts, districts covered, and milestones reached.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Donor Receipts:</b> Every contribution receives a formal
        tax-deductible receipt with our EIN for your records.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Open Communication:</b> Our team responds to donor inquiries
        directly. Reach us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:partnerships@nivaranfoundation.org">
          partnerships@nivaranfoundation.org
        </a>{" "}
        with any questions about fund allocation or program outcomes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Hold Us to Our Word</h2>
    <p>
      We believe donors should be skeptical, ask questions, and demand
      evidence. That is not a burden to us. It is the standard we set for
      ourselves. If you want to see exactly how your contribution is being
      used, we will show you. If you want to visit a health camp or review
      financial documents, we welcome the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The communities we serve across Nepal's most underserved districts
      cannot afford for a single dollar to be wasted. Neither can we. That
      is why accountability is not a section on our website. It is the
      operating principle behind every decision we make.
