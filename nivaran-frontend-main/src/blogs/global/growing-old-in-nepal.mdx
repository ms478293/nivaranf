In the bustling streets of Bharatpur, Nepal's rapidly growing city, 74-year-old Maya\* sits patiently in a crowded hospital corridor. She has been waiting for three hours to see a doctor about her hypertension medication. Her experience mirrors a growing healthcare crisis facing Nepal's elderly population, according to groundbreaking new research published in <Link href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-024-11717-2" className="text-primary-main">BMC Health Services Research</Link>.

    <h2>The Family Support Paradox</h2>
    <p>
      The study reveals a stark contrast in healthcare access between elderly
      Nepalese living with family members and those aging alone. While
      traditional family structures have long been the backbone of elderly care
      in Nepal, increasing youth migration is creating concerning gaps in this
      support system.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish my children were with me and around the house," shares one
      80-year-old participant living alone. "Now, I live alone, so I feel very
      lonely. My children bring food and medicine for me when they visit me once
      every three months; that is, it."
    </p>
    <h2>Insurance: Promise vs. Reality</h2>
    <p>
      Nepal's push toward universal health coverage through its national health
      insurance scheme presents a complex picture. While the program offers
      coverage up to 100,000 Nepalese Rupees (approximately $750) for a family
      of five at an annual premium of 3,500 Rupees, the reality on the ground
      tells a different story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They give us cheap medicine and ask us to buy other medicines on our
      own," reports one participant with health insurance. "If a hospital
      receives 100 rupees for medicine, then 40 rupees will be used only in
      medicine. They only provide paracetamol."
    </p>
    <h2>Multiple Barriers to Access</h2>
    <p>
      The research identifies several critical challenges facing elderly
      patients:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Poor communication between healthcare providers and elderly patients
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Extended waiting times at public facilities</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of elderly-friendly infrastructure</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited availability of quality medications</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Transportation difficulties, even in accessible regions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Urban-Rural Divide</h2>
    <p>
      While the study focused on Bharatpur, one of Nepal's more accessible
      cities, researchers suggest these challenges are likely amplified in rural
      areas. With approximately 10.21% of Nepal's population now aged 60 or
      above, according to the 2021 census, the pressure on healthcare systems is
      mounting.
    </p>
    <h2>A Call for Change</h2>
    <p>
      Healthcare experts are advocating for systematic reforms to address these
      challenges. The study recommends:

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>
  As Nepal grapples with rapid population aging, the need for targeted
  healthcare solutions becomes increasingly urgent. The study's findings suggest
  that while family support remains crucial, systematic changes are needed to
  ensure adequate healthcare access for the elderly.
</p>
<p>
  "It obviously feels different and difficult than before," reflects one
  80-year-old participant. "Now I cannot work like I used to do. Now I cannot
  function like before."
