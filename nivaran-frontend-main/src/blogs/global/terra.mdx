  Environmental Health: Where the Air You Breathe and the Water You Drink
  Determine Your Health
</h1>

Project Terra is Nivaran Foundation's initiative addressing the intersection of environmental conditions and public health in Nepal. As part of Nivaran's core healthcare mission, Project Terra recognizes that you cannot improve community health without addressing the environmental factors that cause disease in the first place.

In Nepal, indoor air pollution from traditional cooking stoves is a leading cause of respiratory illness, particularly among women and children. Contaminated water sources cause widespread waterborne diseases including typhoid, cholera, and chronic diarrheal illness. Poor sanitation and waste management create breeding grounds for disease vectors. Project Terra brings these environmental health challenges into Nivaran's healthcare framework, addressing causes rather than just treating symptoms.

      The health of a community is inseparable from the quality of its air,
      water, and environment. Project Terra is working to prevent disease at its
      source by ensuring that the environments where Nepali families live, cook,
      and drink are safe and clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the right support and collaboration, we can address the environmental
      root causes of illness and build healthier communities across Nepal.
