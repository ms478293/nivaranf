  The Battle for Every Breath: Understanding the Link Between Childhood Asthma
  and Air Pollution{" "}
</h1>

Every breath should be a source of life, not a struggle for survival. Yet, for millions of children worldwide, the air they breathe is a silent threat, triggering asthma attacks and stealing their chance at a healthy childhood. The culprit? Air pollution, a growing menace fueled by climate change and environmental injustice.

      Imagine a child gasping for air, their small chest heaving with each
      labored breath, their eyes wide with panic. This is the reality for
      childhood asthma, a chronic respiratory disease that inflames and narrows
      the airways, turning each breath into a battle. While genetics and
      allergies play a role, air pollution is a significant and often overlooked
      trigger, exacerbating this already challenging condition.{" "}

      As our planet warms and unsustainable practices continue, air quality
      deteriorates. Rising temperatures create ideal conditions for ground-level
      ozone which forms a harmful component of smog. Wildfires, exacerbated by
      drought and heat, release massive amounts of smoke and particulate matter
      that travel long distances, blanketing communities in a haze of harmful
      pollutants. These pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and
      particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), irritate children's sensitive
      airways, triggering asthma attacks and worsening existing respiratory
      conditions.{" "}

      The consequences are devastating. Individuals who suffers from childhood
      asthma misses school, struggle to play, and face increased
      hospitalizations. Their developing lungs, still in their crucial growth
      phase, may suffer long-term damage, impacting their health and well-being
      throughout their lives . In some cases, asthma attacks can be fatal.{" "}

      Sadly, the burden of this silent struggle falls disproportionately on
      vulnerable communities. Children living in poverty, often residing in
      areas with higher pollution levels and limited access to healthcare, are
      at greater risk. This creates a vicious cycle where air pollution
      continues to harm children’s health, while the immediate needs of a crisis
      overshadow the importance of tackling pollution.{" "}

      is highlighted by Nivaran Foundation, and explores how air pollution as a
      consequence of global conflict is adversely affecting children's health.
      This inequity demands our attention and action. A study by the EPA found
      that African American adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the
      effects of air pollution, experiencing respiratory changes even at low
      levels of ozone.{" "}

      The science behind this vulnerability is clear. Children breathe more
      rapidly than adults, taking in more air relative to their body weight.
      Their airways are narrower, and their immune systems are still developing,
      making them more susceptible to the harmful effects of pollutants.
      Exposure to air pollution in early childhood can hinder lung development
      and increase the risk of developing asthma later in life.{" "}
