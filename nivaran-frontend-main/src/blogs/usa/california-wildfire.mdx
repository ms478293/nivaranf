As of January 15, 2025, the California wildfires have devastated the region, claiming 25 lives, displacing tens of thousands, and destroying over 10,000 structures. With strong winds and dry conditions worsening the crisis, millions across Southern California remain under critical fire threat. The Palisades Fire alone has consumed 23,713 acres and is only 18% contained, leaving communities grappling with unimaginable losses.

## A State Under Siege

The fires continue to wreak havoc across Los Angeles and surrounding counties. Among the largest are:

High winds forecasted through Wednesday, with gusts up to 50 mph, threaten to intensify existing blazes and spark new ones. These extreme conditions are leaving first responders, already stretched thin, racing against time.

  ## The Toll of the Crisis
  
  Communities also face predatory challenges. Governor Gavin Newsom has issued
  an executive order to block aggressive under-market-value real estate offers
  targeting vulnerable wildfire victims. Meanwhile, two schools destroyed in the
  Palisades Fire will soon reopen at temporary campuses, offering some hope of
  normalcy amid chaos.
  
  The fires have now claimed 25 lives, including nine in the Palisades Fire and 16 in the Eaton Fire. Air quality remains dangerously low, with ash and smoke blanketing the region, prompting officials to urge residents to wear respiratory masks. A dust and ash advisory is in effect for over 17 million residents.

## Climate Change’s Role

Scientists attribute the fires’ unprecedented intensity to climate change. A UCLA analysis reveals the blazes burned hotter and larger due to planet-warming fossil fuel pollution, amplifying a disaster that may have been less severe in a world without climate change.

## Nivaran Foundation’s Relief Efforts

The Nivaran Foundation remains on the ground, providing critical aid to displaced families. Efforts include distributing emergency cash assistance, food, clean water, and supplies.
