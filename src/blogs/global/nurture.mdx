  Protecting the Health of Mothers and Children
</h1>

Project Nurture is Nivaran Foundation's dedicated maternal and child health initiative, addressing the critical healthcare needs of mothers and children across Nepal. As part of Nivaran's core healthcare mission, Project Nurture tackles the root causes of maternal and infant mortality through direct medical services, nutrition programs, and community health education.

Nepal continues to face significant challenges in maternal and child health. Many women in rural areas lack access to prenatal care, skilled birth attendants, and postnatal support. Children under five remain vulnerable to malnutrition, preventable diseases, and lack of pediatric services. Project Nurture brings healthcare directly to these communities, building on Nivaran's proven track record of 304 health camps serving 61,200+ patients across 52 districts.
