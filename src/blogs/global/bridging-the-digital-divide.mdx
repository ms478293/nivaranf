Education is a cornerstone of development, yet millions of children worldwide face insurmountable barriers to accessing even the most basic learning opportunities. According to a 2022 report by <Link href="https://www.unesco.org/gem-report/en/articles/244m-children-wont-start-new-school-year" className="text-primary-main">UNICEF</Link>, 244 million children globally are out of school. For those in school, inequities in access to quality education persist, particularly in low-income regions where the digital divide remains stark. As technology becomes an increasingly integral part of education, bridging this divide has become essential to ensuring every child has a fair chance at success.

## Understanding the Digital Divide

<BlogParagraph>

The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to digital technology and those who do not. It disproportionately impacts children in developing nations, especially in rural and remote areas.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these disparities. While schools in wealthier countries pivoted to online learning, many in low-income nations closed entirely, resulting in more than 1 billion students facing disrupted education globally <Link href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/" style={{color:"#eb5834"}}>(World Economic Forum, 2021)</Link>.

## Why Bridging the Gap Matters?

<BlogParagraph>

Access to education is a fundamental human right, as recognized by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4. However, the lack of digital tools and connectivity creates a cycle of poverty, inequality, and unrealized potential:
