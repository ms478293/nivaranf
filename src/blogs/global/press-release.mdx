## Nivaran Foundation Announces Largest Healthcare and Education Initiative for Rural Nepal

Nivaran Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (EIN: 41-2656587) headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, with operations based at CTC Mall, Sundhara, Kathmandu, Nepal. The foundation focuses on two core missions: delivering healthcare to underserved rural populations through Project Sanjeevani, and expanding access to quality education through Project Vidya. Together, these initiatives represent a sustained, multi-phase commitment to the communities that Nepal's existing systems have not been able to reach.

    <p>
      Nivaran Foundation exists to close the gap between Nepal's urban
      healthcare infrastructure and the millions of citizens in rural
      municipalities who lack access to basic medical services and quality
      education. We operate through two flagship programs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Project Sanjeevani</b> -- our healthcare initiative delivering
        mobile health camps staffed by specialist medical teams to remote
        communities across five provinces.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Project Vidya</b> -- our education initiative focused on teacher
        training, digital learning infrastructure, scholarships, and school
        facility improvements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With 85% of all funds directed to programs, 10% to administration,
      and 5% to fundraising, we maintain one of the leanest cost structures
      among nonprofits operating in Nepal.

      Project Sanjeevani is the Nivaran Foundation's flagship healthcare
      initiative. It is designed to bring multi-specialty medical care
      directly to Nepal's most remote communities through a phased,
      decade-long strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Phase I (2025-2027): Mobile Health Camps</b> -- The foundation
      will deploy 304 health camps across 52 districts in five provinces,
      targeting 61,200+ patients with an $18 million budget. Twenty-four
      technical medical teams, each comprising general practitioners, eye
      specialists, dentists, ENT specialists, and lab technicians, will
      rotate across 252 municipalities to deliver comprehensive care.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Phase II (2027-2029):</b> Establishment of a permanent Nivaran
      Health Centers network to provide ongoing primary care in districts
      served during Phase I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Phase III (2027-2032):</b> Construction of 50-bed hospitals
      across 77 districts, creating district-level healthcare
      infrastructure where none currently exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Phase IV (2032-2036):</b> Development of a 700+ bed central
      hospital to serve as a research, learning, and training hub for
      healthcare professionals across Nepal.

      measurement, vision screening, hearing assessment, dental checkups,
      portable X-ray and ultrasound, chronic condition screening, and
      referrals for follow-up care.

      Project Vidya (2027-2033) is the Nivaran Foundation's education
      initiative, designed to address the systemic barriers that prevent
      children in rural Nepal from receiving quality education. The project
      focuses on three pillars:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Teacher Training:</b> Equipping at least 1,000 teachers with
        technology-integrated, inclusive teaching methods through
        structured professional development programs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scholarships:</b> Providing financial support for students from
        economically disadvantaged families, with a particular focus on
        girls' education and enrollment retention beyond primary school.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>School Infrastructure:</b> Establishing 100 digital learning
        centers, upgrading classroom facilities, improving sanitation, and
        building smart classroom environments powered by modern technology.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Vidya operates in coordination with Sanjeevani. Communities that
      receive health camps are prioritized for education support, creating
      an integrated approach where healthcare and education reinforce each
      other.

    <p>
      The Nivaran Foundation invites organizations at the global, national,
      and local level to support Project Sanjeevani health camps through
      direct funding, medical supply donations, and volunteer deployment.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Fund a Health Camp:</b> Organizations can sponsor individual
        camps or a series of camps within a specific province or district.
        Each camp serves up to 200 patients with multi-specialty care.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Donate Medical Supplies and Equipment:</b> We accept donations
        of diagnostic instruments, pharmaceuticals, lab equipment, dental
        tools, and ophthalmic devices that meet our quality standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Deploy Medical Volunteers:</b> Hospitals, medical schools, and
        healthcare organizations can send qualified professionals to join
        our teams on the ground during camp rotations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Support Education Infrastructure:</b> Fund teacher training
        programs, sponsor scholarships, or contribute to the construction
        and equipping of digital learning centers under Project Vidya.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All organizational partnerships are structured with clear
      deliverables, reporting timelines, and impact metrics. We provide
      detailed camp-level data to every supporting organization, including
      patient counts, services rendered, and cost breakdowns.
