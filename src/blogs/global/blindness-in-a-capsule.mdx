In a health post in Jumla, one of Nepal's most remote districts, a medical aid named Khem held a small bottle containing yellow capsules that had the power to prevent permanent blindness in children. Each capsule cost less than one rupee. The vitamin A powder inside had been refined across decades of research to determine exactly the micronutrient density needed to restore sight-preserving retinal function.

Khem showed the bottle with a mixture of frustration and resignation. 'We have the medicine,' she said. 'We have known for years that vitamin A prevents childhood blindness. The dosage is simple. The cost is negligible. Yet children in this district still go blind from something entirely preventable. Not because the medicine does not work. Because the logistics do.'

This observation—that a child can have access to one of public health's greatest successes and still become blind—captures the defining gap that Nivaran Foundation has spent recent years documenting: the distance between having a solution and having that solution reach the people who need it.

Nepal's Ministry of Health designed the annual vitamin A supplementation program well: all children aged nine months to five years should receive high-dose vitamin A supplementation twice yearly—a capsule given at their local health post during designated campaigns. The program is well-designed and evidence-based. But implementation and impact are different things.

The campaign happens on predetermined dates: all health posts must administer capsules during that specific week. But a family's capacity to bring a child to the health post depends on harvest schedules, work demands, transportation availability, and whether the family even knows the date of the campaign. In Jumla's scattered settlements, that information gap is significant. 'We post announcements,' Khem said, showing a handwritten notice on the health post door. 'But many families never come to this health post. They do not know about the announcement. Even if they did, they cannot come during that week because they are working.'

Khem had documented four cases of children going blind from vitamin A deficiency in her post's catchment in the past five years. All four were preventable. The families were not against supplementation. They did not know the children were at risk. They did not know they needed to travel to this post on that particular date. 'By the time they brought the child to clinic for other reasons and I saw the night blindness—that characteristic inability to see in dim light that signals vitamin A deficiency—the corneal damage was already underway.'

A Nivaran field coordinator named Anamika had been working to strengthen vitamin A delivery in Jumla. Her approach was straightforward: stop assuming that families can come to the health post, and instead position supplementation where families were already gathering. 'We mapped the calendar,' Anamika explained. 'When do large numbers of families concentrate in one place? Markets, festivals, school enrollment days, post-harvest gatherings. We worked with local partners to position vitamin A supplementation at those venues—not as a special clinic, but as one service among others.'

The data was striking: when Nivaran positioned vitamin A supplementation at the weekly market rather than requiring people to come to the health post during campaign week, supplementation rates increased from roughly forty percent to over seventy percent.

A grandmother named Bimala brought her two-year-old grandson to the supplementation table at a market, having walked there for grain. She saw the line and brought her grandson forward. She did not know what vitamin A did. But the service was there, in the space where her life was already occurring. 'In my village, no one talks about blindness as something that happens to children,' she said. 'If you told me that blindness is preventable with a small capsule, I would want that capsule. But I would never have made a special trip. This way—this just works.'

A young man named Gopal had become blind from vitamin A deficiency in childhood. He was now in his twenties, and he described the moment when night blindness became day blindness with the flat pain of someone recounting a preventable loss. 'I was nine years old when my grandmother realized I could not see at night. By then, the damage was done. We would have given me the capsule if we had known. We just did not know.'

Gopal's story represents what Nivaran argues is an invisible crisis: childhood blindness that is prevented by a dollar intervention for most of Nepal's children but still occurs in communities where logistics fail. The tragedy is not that the solution is unknown. The tragedy is that the solution reaches some children but not others, based on geography and family circumstance, not medical need.

Khem set the bottle of capsules on her table and looked at it for a long moment. 'This is the entire solution,' she said. 'One capsule per child, twice yearly, costs almost nothing, prevents permanent blindness. The question is not whether the medicine works. The question is whether our systems have the sense to get it into children's bodies before the disease gets into their eyes.' When Nivaran positioned supplementation at the market, that simple change meant that the answer, finally, became yes.

The Nivaran Foundation's vitamin A supplementation work in Jumla also revealed something about how health workers relate to their work in contexts of chronic supply and logistics failure. Health workers like Khem who watched children go blind from preventable causes despite having the medicine available—but being unable to deliver it reliably—described a specific form of professional demoralization. Not the acute despair of emergency failure, but a chronic erosion of confidence in the system they were part of. 'You know the answer,' one health worker described, 'and you cannot reach the person who needs it. You do this for years, and you begin to wonder why you went into health work at all.'

Addressing this demoralization is not merely a matter of staff wellbeing—though that matters. It is a matter of system performance. Health workers who feel that the system they serve is genuinely trying to improve outcomes are more likely to remain in their posts, more likely to maintain high standards, more likely to go beyond minimal requirements when family circumstances are difficult. The recruitment and retention crisis in rural Nepal's health sector is not primarily about salary—though salary matters. It is substantially about whether health workers believe the system supports their ability to actually help people. Logistics improvement—ensuring medicine gets to where it is needed—is not just a supply chain issue. It is a morale and retention issue.

The broader lesson from the vitamin A work is that the last mile of health delivery—the final connection between medicine and patient—deserves the same strategic attention as any earlier part of the supply chain. Nepal has made enormous investments in procuring vitamin A, manufacturing it, distributing it to districts. The investment in ensuring it reaches the children who need it—through market-based delivery, community health worker positioning, school-based programs—has been comparatively small. Closing this last-mile gap should not be treated as a logistical afterthought. It is where the impact either happens or fails to happen. It is where children either see or go blind.
