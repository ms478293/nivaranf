## Managing $18 million in donor funds across 52 districts requires discipline, transparency, and a relentless focus on outcomes. Here is how we do it.

<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4" key="0">
  <BlogParagraph>
    <p>
      The Nivaran Foundation manages substantial resources on behalf of our
      donors. Phase I of Project Sanjeevani alone carries an $18 million
      budget to deliver 304 health camps across five provinces in Nepal.
      With that scale comes an obligation to account for every dollar with
      precision and integrity.
    </p>
    <h2>How We Allocate Funds</h2>
    <p>
      Our fund allocation model is designed to keep the maximum possible
      share of every donation working directly for communities in Nepal:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>85% goes directly to programs.</b> This funds our two core
        initiatives: Project Sanjeevani (healthcare) and Project Vidya
        (education). It covers medical team deployment, pharmaceutical
        supplies, diagnostic equipment, teacher training programs,
        scholarships, and school infrastructure improvements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>10% covers administration.</b> This includes coordination
        between our Boston, Massachusetts office and our Kathmandu operations
        center, financial reporting systems, compliance, and staff.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>5% supports fundraising.</b> A lean investment in donor
        outreach and communications that sustains the pipeline of
        resources our programs depend on.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We benchmark ourselves against industry standards. The Better
      Business Bureau recommends nonprofits allocate at least 65% to
      programs. We consistently deliver 85%.
    </p>
    <h2>What the Budget Actually Funds</h2>
    <p>
      Behind the percentages are real costs that translate directly into
      patient care and educational outcomes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>24 technical medical teams</b> comprising general practitioners,
        eye specialists, dentists, and ENT specialists deployed across
        52 districts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Diagnostic equipment and supplies</b> including lab testing kits,
        portable X-ray and ultrasound machines, dental instruments, and
        ophthalmic tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Camp logistics</b> covering transportation, site setup, patient
        registration systems, and community outreach in remote
        municipalities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Education infrastructure</b> through Project Vidya, funding
        teacher training for technology-integrated classrooms, student
        scholarships, and school facility upgrades.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Financial Oversight and Reporting</h2>
    <p>
      We maintain rigorous financial controls at every level:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Annual Financial Reports:</b> Comprehensive revenue and
        expenditure statements published each fiscal year and available
        to any donor upon request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Independent Audits:</b> Third-party financial reviews ensure
        our reported figures are accurate and our practices meet
        regulatory standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>IRS Compliance:</b> As a 501(c)(3) organization (EIN:
        99-3919025), we file annual returns with the IRS and maintain
        full compliance with federal nonprofit regulations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Program-Level Tracking:</b> Each health camp generates
        itemized expense reports tied to patient outcomes, allowing us
        to calculate cost-per-patient and cost-per-service metrics.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sustainable Funding for Long-Term Programs</h2>
    <p>
      Project Sanjeevani is a multi-phase initiative spanning over a
      decade. Phase I (2025-2027) focuses on health camps. Future phases
      will establish permanent health centers and district hospitals. This
      long-term vision requires sustainable funding, which is why we
      diversify our revenue across individual donors, institutional
      grants, and community fundraising.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not over-rely on any single funding source. This protects
      program continuity and ensures that the communities we serve are
      not left without care if any one revenue stream fluctuates.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Right to Ask Questions</h2>
    <p>
      We welcome financial inquiries from current and prospective donors.
      If you want to understand how a specific donation was used, request
      a copy of our annual report, or discuss our budget in detail, our
      team is available at <a href="mailto:partnerships@nivaranfoundation.org">partnerships@nivaranfoundation.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Financial responsibility is not a marketing message for us. It is
      a commitment to the 61,200 patients we aim to serve and the donors
      who make that possible. <a href="/donate"><b>Support our mission</b></a> with confidence
      that your contribution is managed with care.
