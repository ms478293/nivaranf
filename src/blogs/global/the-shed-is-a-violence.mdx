There is a small structure at the edge of the property. It is made of stone and mud. It is low-ceilinged, poorly ventilated, without heat. During the winter months, when temperatures in the hills of Nepal drop below freezing at night, this structure is cold enough that breath clouds in the air inside it. It is called a chhau goth—a menstrual shed. And in it, every month, a woman or girl is confined during her period.

Nepal officially banned the practice of chhaupadi—the custom requiring menstruating women to live separately from their households—in 2017. But laws and practices exist in different timescales. The custom is ancient, rooted in beliefs that associate menstruation with impurity and danger to household prosperity. Changing a belief that has governed women's bodies and movements for generations requires more than legislative prohibition. It requires sustained community engagement, changed understanding, and the confidence to resist social pressure.

Meanwhile, women continue to be sent to sheds. And women continue to die in those sheds—from cold exposure, from snakebite, from the respiratory infections that confined, inadequately heated spaces produce. The deaths are documented. They make news. Policy makers express concern. And then, the next month, another woman is sent to another shed.

The Nivaran Foundation's work on chhaupadi does not begin with the legal argument, though the law matters. It begins with the health argument, because the health consequences of chhaupadi are severe and measurable. Women confined in unheated sheds during winter months develop respiratory illness. Women sleeping on cold ground develop urinary tract infections and other complications. Women isolated from household support during menstruation receive delayed care when other health problems arise. Adolescent girls confined during menstruation miss school days—every month, reliably—accumulating educational deficits that affect their long-term wellbeing.

But the health argument alone does not change practice. The families who send women to sheds are not acting from indifference to women's health. They are acting from a complex web of belief, social pressure, and fear—fear of bad luck, fear of community judgment, fear of what might happen if the custom is violated. Addressing this requires understanding the web rather than simply asserting that the health consequences are bad.

The foundation works with community health workers who are themselves from the communities where chhaupadi persists. These are not outsiders bringing Western values or national legal mandates. They are community members who have lived alongside the practice, who understand what sustains it, and who can engage with it from within the community's own framework.

The approach is gradual. It begins with conversations about health—not confrontational challenges to tradition but genuine dialogue about what chhaupadi means for women's wellbeing. It includes engaging with men and community elders who hold influence over household practice. It involves working with religious leaders to explore whether the religious dimensions of chhaupadi—the associations with purification and auspiciousness—require the specific practice of shed confinement or whether other practices could serve the same spiritual purpose.

Progress is slow and uneven. Some families stop confining women to sheds after engagement with foundation health workers. Others continue the practice. Some households find intermediate positions—sleeping inside but observing other restrictions. Some communities see the practice shift in younger generations even as older generations continue it.

What is clear from the foundation's documentation is that legal prohibition without community engagement produces minimal change. Women continue to be sent to sheds in districts where the law prohibits it, in communities that know the law exists, because the social pressure that enforces the custom is more immediate than the law's enforcement. Changing behavior requires changing the social environment—creating communities where not confining women during menstruation is normal, where the custom is understood as harmful rather than protective, where families feel safe to resist.

The shed at the edge of the property is a physical manifestation of a belief system. Dismantling the shed is easy—a few hours of labor. Dismantling the belief requires something harder: sustained, patient, respectful engagement with communities on their own terms, building understanding gradually rather than demanding immediate compliance. The violence is not just in the cold nights and the respiratory infections. It is in the message the shed sends to women and girls about their value and their status. Changing that message—through health outcomes, through community conversation, through demonstration that another way is possible—is the work of transforming what the shed means, and ultimately of transforming whether it needs to exist at all.

The death rate among women and girls confined to menstrual sheds in Nepal has received episodic media attention when particularly tragic cases emerge—a young woman dying of hypothermia, a girl bitten by a snake seeking refuge from the cold. These cases generate outrage and calls for enforcement of the 2017 ban. But the outrage fades and enforcement remains inconsistent. The Nivaran Foundation documents a pattern that should be familiar by now: laws that change practice require sustained enforcement, community engagement, and alternative pathways—not just prohibition.

The alternative pathway question is particularly important. Chhaupadi exists partly because it solves a real social problem: the management of culturally-marked impurity in a way that satisfies community expectations about protection and propriety. Eliminating the practice without providing an alternative pathway for managing these cultural expectations leaves families without a socially acceptable solution, which means many families will continue the practice covertly rather than risk community sanction for non-compliance.

The Nivaran Foundation has worked with communities on developing alternative practices—ways of observing the cultural significance of menstruation that do not require physical separation and exposure to cold, dangerous environments. In some communities, this has involved working with religious leaders to develop substitute rituals. In others, it has meant creating private spaces within homes that serve the same symbolic function as the shed without the health risk. These alternatives are imperfect and culturally contested. But they represent a middle path between enforcing prohibition that communities resist and accepting a practice that kills women and girls. The shed is a violence. Eliminating it requires creating something to replace it that communities will accept, not just prohibiting what they will not abandon.
