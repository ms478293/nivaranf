The earthquake registered 5.5 on the Richter scale. It lasted eighteen seconds. In Kathmandu, buildings swayed. In the districts further north where the epicenter was located, the ground shook violently enough to cause people to run outside. The official damage assessment would take weeks. The immediate response would take days. But within the first hours, something became clear: the question was not whether Nepal's buildings could survive the earthquake. The question was whether Nepal's health systems could survive the disruptions that earthquakes caused.

This is the perspective the Nivaran Foundation brought to the January 7, 2026 earthquake. Not the earthquake itself—that is a geological event—but the cascade of system disruptions that earthquakes trigger, particularly in regions where health systems already operate with minimal margins. In this frame, preparedness is not about whether your building will collapse. It is about whether your patients will get their medications when roads are disrupted. Whether pregnant women can reach hospitals when transportation breaks down. Whether the routine care that keeps people healthy can continue when communication systems fail.

Nepal had experienced this exact scenario less than eleven years earlier. The 2015 earthquake killed nearly 9,000 people. The immediate causes were direct—buildings collapsing, injuries from falling objects. But the secondary causes were systemic: roads damaged, making transport impossible; communication networks down, making coordination impossible; supply chains disrupted, making medicines unavailable. The health sector learned from that disaster. But learning is not the same as preparation.

The Nivaran Foundation's systematic audit of health system preparedness, conducted in the weeks after the January 2026 earthquake, identified a specific problem: preparedness plans existed in documents. But the systems to implement those plans existed partially or not at all.

A field worker in the epicenter district captured something important: 'After shaking, people look for two things: clear instructions and proof someone is already moving.' This is a sophisticated observation about disaster psychology. In the immediate hours after an earthquake, communities are disoriented. Clear instructions—do this, go there, wait here—provide cognitive order in a moment of confusion. But instructions alone are not enough. People need to see that someone is already responding, that the system is already activated, that it is not just them.

The Nivaran Foundation found that many health facilities had plans for this response. But they had not actually practiced implementing those plans. A doctor at a district hospital explained: 'We have a binder with our earthquake response protocol. It is very good. But we have never actually practiced executing it when the phones do not work and we do not know what is happening outside the hospital.' This doctor was not being critical. He was identifying the gap between knowing what to do and being able to do it when the systems you normally depend on—communication, transportation, supply chains—are disrupted.

The Foundation's audit identified three critical gaps in preparation. The first was medication continuity. Most health facilities had been instructed to maintain two-week supplies of essential medications. But when earthquake disruptions lasted longer than two weeks, and resupply was impossible, facilities ran out of critical medicines. The gap was not in the protocol. The gap was in the buffer: two weeks was not enough, but nobody had calculated how long disruptions typically lasted or what buffer was actually needed.

The second was local decision-making capacity. Most health facilities were designed to function within a coordinated system. But when communication was disrupted, facilities could not reach district authorities. Some facilities waited for central decisions that never came. Others made decisions on their own without knowing what decisions had been made at district level, leading to coordination failures. The gap was that health workers had not practiced making decisions independently.

The third was practiced repetition. Plans do not translate into action automatically. A health worker described it: 'We read the protocol once. Then it goes in a file. When the earthquake came, we did not remember what it said.' The gap was not in the protocol. The gap was in practice. Plans need to be drilled repeatedly so that they become operational reflexes rather than intellectual documents.

The Foundation's response was not to create new protocols. It was to activate something more fundamental: working with district and facility leaders to establish regular drills. One session per month, every facility would simulate an earthquake disruption: assume communication is down, assume resupply is impossible, assume you are making decisions independently. What would you do? What information do you need? What decisions can you make without district approval? These drills were not sophisticated. They were simple scenarios—'it is day three after the earthquake, the phones still do not work, and you are running low on oxygen.' How long can you stretch your oxygen? When do you need to start rationing? These questions, practiced in calm times, make response possible in crisis times.

The Nivaran Foundation's analysis concluded with a principle that became the foundation for their post-earthquake recommendations: 'Preparedness is trust made visible before fear takes over.' This sentence captures something essential about disaster response. The trust between communities and health systems is not built when crisis comes. It is built in preparation—when health workers drill repeatedly, when supplies are positioned strategically, when clear instructions are communicated over and over, when communities see that the system is taking disruption seriously. When the earthquake comes and crisis induces panic, that pre-existing trust makes people believe that health systems will continue functioning. Without that trust, even adequate responses seem like failures.

The earth shook on January 7, 2026. The health systems survived the shaking. But the real test will come when the next earthquake comes, and the disruptions last longer, and the communications do not work. Then, what the Nivaran Foundation learned in the weeks after January's earthquake will matter. Trust made visible will become the foundation that health systems stand on when the ground beneath them becomes unstable.

The foundation's audit revealed one additional preparation gap that appeared consistently across districts: the gap between individual facility preparedness and system-level coordination. Individual health facilities could have excellent internal protocols. But when a district-wide earthquake struck, facilities needed to communicate with each other—to share information about which facilities had capacity, which were overwhelmed, where surge patients should be directed. Without pre-established communication protocols and regular practice, this system-level coordination failed even when individual facility protocols functioned.

One district health officer described the challenge with precision: 'During the earthquake, three facilities had capacity. Two were overwhelmed. But we could not communicate between them to redirect patients. Patients arrived at overwhelmed facilities because they did not know about the facilities with capacity. If we had practiced district-wide coordination drills, this might have been different.' The individual-level solution—each facility preparing its own protocol—was necessary but insufficient. The system-level solution—practiced coordination between facilities—was equally necessary and largely absent.

The Nivaran Foundation's recommendation emerging from the earthquake response analysis was for annual district-level preparedness exercises—not facility-specific drills, but multi-facility, district-wide simulations where every health facility participates simultaneously, communication protocols are tested in real-time, and patient surge scenarios are played out. These exercises are more expensive and logistically complex than facility-specific drills. They are also far more likely to reveal the coordination failures that individual preparation cannot prevent. The investment is justified by one arithmetic truth: every preventable death that results from coordination failure during a disaster is a failure that practice could have prevented.
