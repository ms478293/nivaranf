She is thirteen years old and she has been managing her period for eight months without reliable access to sanitary pads. What she uses instead are strips of cloth, folded and refolded, that she washes and reuses. They are not adequate. They leak. They require management throughout the school day—management that requires access to a private toilet, access to water for cleaning, and the confidence that leakage will not be visible to classmates. None of these are reliably available at her school.

So she stays home. The first day of her period, usually, and sometimes the second. Every month. This has been happening since she started menstruating eight months ago. She has missed approximately sixteen school days to menstruation in eight months. Her attendance record shows unexplained absences. Her teachers see gaps in her learning. Her academic trajectory has already begun to diverge from the trajectory it would have followed if she had reliable access to basic menstrual hygiene supplies.

The connection between menstrual health and girls' education is well-documented and routinely underappreciated. In communities where menstrual hygiene management is inadequate—where girls lack access to disposable pads or adequate reusable alternatives, where schools lack private toilets and water, where menstruation is treated as shameful rather than normal—girls miss school during menstruation. They miss school reliably, every month. The missed days accumulate into educational gaps. The educational gaps undermine academic performance. The undermined performance reduces families' investment in continued education. Girls leave school earlier.

The Nivaran Foundation has been working on menstrual health as an educational intervention as much as a health intervention. The two cannot be separated. Adequate menstrual hygiene enables school attendance. School attendance enables education. Education transforms health outcomes for the next generation. The pad is not just a hygiene product. It is an educational access tool. It is, in the longer arc of community health, a public health investment.

The foundation's work in schools begins with a supply component: working with local governments and NGO partners to ensure that girls in remote areas have access to affordable or subsidized sanitary pads. But supply alone does not solve the problem. A girl who has a pad but attends a school with no private toilet and no water for washing still faces barriers. Supply without adequate facilities is supply that cannot be used.

So the foundation also works with schools on facilities: advocating for private toilets with water access, working with local governments on the infrastructure investments that make menstrual hygiene management possible, engaging school administrators on creating environments where girls feel safe managing their periods without shame.

And the foundation works on the cultural dimension: engaging with communities on the normalization of menstruation. When menstruation is treated as shameful—when girls hide their periods, when any visible evidence of menstruation is catastrophically embarrassing—the inadequacy of hygiene management becomes doubly harmful. Girls manage not just the physical challenge of inadequate supplies but the social terror of exposure. The shame creates additional motivation to stay home, to avoid the risk of embarrassment, to choose invisibility over attendance.

The foundation has found that the most effective approach engages with boys and teachers as well as girls. Boys who understand that menstruation is normal—who have not been taught to treat it as disgusting or shameful—create school environments where girls feel less at risk of humiliation. Teachers who understand menstrual health can respond appropriately when a girl needs to manage her period during school hours rather than treating it as disruption or absence from class.

The thirteen-year-old girl at home during her period is not choosing to fall behind in school. She is responding rationally to a situation where the alternative—attending school with inadequate hygiene management—poses risks she cannot afford. Her decision is reasonable given her constraints. But her constraints are not inevitable. They are changeable. Access to adequate sanitary supplies, decent school facilities, and supportive school environments transforms her calculation entirely.

When the foundation has provided these elements in communities, school attendance among adolescent girls increases measurably during menstrual days. Girls who previously stayed home reliably during the first one to two days of their period show up. Their academic trajectories improve. Their families observe the improvement and invest more in their continued education. The pad that keeps a girl in school becomes the link in a chain that ultimately leads to better health for the community the girl will serve as an educated adult woman.

The connection between menstrual hygiene management and school attendance is now sufficiently documented that it has influenced global development policy, with several international organizations including it as a priority within their education and health programming. What is less well-documented—and what the Nivaran Foundation has been tracking in Nepal—is the dose-response relationship: how much does menstrual hygiene support need to improve before school attendance benefits become measurable?

The foundation's data suggests that the threshold is lower than might be expected. Girls do not need perfect menstrual hygiene management to attend school regularly during their periods. They need adequate management—access to supplies that provide reasonable reliability, toilet facilities that provide enough privacy, and a school environment that does not punish or humiliate them for period-related needs. The perfect is the enemy of the good here: waiting for ideal facilities before providing any support leaves girls at home in the interim. Providing adequate support—imperfect but functional—improves attendance immediately.

The girl who stays in school because she has access to sanitary supplies becomes, over the years of her education, something the health system desperately needs: a community member with health knowledge, critical thinking capacity, and the confidence to apply that knowledge to her family's and community's health challenges. The pad is not just hygiene. It is not just education. It is the enabling investment that converts a girl's existing intelligence and potential into realized health impact for the entire community. The per-unit cost of that investment—measured in quality-adjusted life-years improved—makes it among the most cost-effective public health interventions available. The pad keeps the girl in school. The school makes the community healthier. The investment compounds.
