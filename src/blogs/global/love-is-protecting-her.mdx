Valentine's Day arrives each year on the same calendar date in Nepal as everywhere else. But the meaning of love, of care, of the commitment that bonds two people, becomes very different when you live in a place where healthcare access depends on geography. The Nivaran Foundation used the occasion of a day dedicated to love to examine something that rarely appears in romantic contexts: reproductive health equity.

This might seem like an unlikely pairing. Yet the foundation's work revealed something profound: real care in relationships must include ensuring that partners have access to reproductive health services. This is not theoretical. It is a daily reality that determines whether women face preventable health risks and whether families begin their journeys with the foundation they need.

Reproductive health access in rural Nepal exists in a state of paradox. Clinical knowledge about safe pregnancy and delivery is well-established. The interventions that prevent maternal and neonatal complications are straightforward: antenatal counseling, identification of high-risk pregnancies, clean facility delivery, immediate access to emergency obstetric care. Yet these interventions remain out of reach for millions of women because of barriers that are equally well-understood: distance, cost, weak referral systems, staff shortages, and poverty.

The operational reality, as field coordinators repeatedly documented, remains: distance is the disease, and delay is its first symptom. In the context of reproductive health, this principle carries particular urgency. Pregnancy is not an illness, but complications during pregnancy and delivery are among the leading causes of death for women in rural Nepal. A woman who experiences postpartum hemorrhage needs access to emergency care not in hours but in minutes. A newborn with complications needs immediate intervention.

The foundation identified a pattern of preventable delays rooted in misinformation and structural barriers. Many youth in rural Nepal had inaccurate understanding of reproductive health services. They believed that contraception had serious side effects without evidence. They thought prenatal counseling was unnecessary if a previous pregnancy had been uncomplicated. They did not know how to recognize danger signs in pregnancy or what constituted a medical emergency.

The foundation's approach, grounded in direct conversation with community members about what they actually needed to know, began with a foundational recognition: women do not lack the desire to have safe pregnancies. Families do not resist good outcomes. The barriers emerge from structure and information. When a young woman receives counseling about reproductive health options before she becomes pregnant, her understanding changes. When she knows what to expect from contraceptive methods and understands how to use them correctly, she can make informed choices.

But information alone is insufficient. The foundation's work revealed that women also need confidence that the health system will function when they reach it. If transportation to reach it is uncertain, if referral processes are opaque, if staff are intermittently present, if the facility frequently lacks essential medications, then a woman's rational decision might be to delay referral and hope that conservative management works.

The Nivaran Foundation's advocacy for reproductive health equity centers on honest acknowledgment of these implementation challenges. Prevention of maternal and neonatal complications depends on early detection and timely intervention. The foundation argues that genuine love in relationships means ensuring that women have both the knowledge to recognize complications and the confidence that the health system will respond.

This is where specific, practical support matters. A partner who understands reproductive health risks and supports his partner to seek antenatal counseling is protecting her. A family that ensures a young woman has access to contraceptive information and methods before she becomes pregnant is protecting her. A referral system that functions reliably so women feel confident that seeking help will result in appropriate care is protecting her.

Valentine's Day is filled with expressions of romantic love. The Nivaran Foundation's perspective on reproductive health equity suggests that real love goes deeper—it includes the commitment to ensuring that the people we care about have access to the health services that keep them safe. It includes supporting family members and partners to seek care when needed. It includes advocating for health systems that serve everyone, not just those with proximity and resources.

Love, in this framing, is not merely an emotion expressed in cards and flowers. It is a commitment to systems that protect. It is advocacy for the infrastructure that ensures a woman can reach a hospital when she needs one. It is the insistence that geography should not determine whether a pregnancy ends in joy or tragedy. Real love, the foundation argues, is protecting her—not just with words but with the systems, knowledge, and access that make safety possible.

The Nivaran Foundation's reproductive health work has paid particular attention to adolescent couples—young people in new partnerships or recent marriages who are making reproductive decisions with limited knowledge and significant social pressure. In communities where early marriage is common, adolescent women may face their first pregnancies before they have had the opportunity to engage with reproductive health services, before they have established relationships with health workers, and before they have developed confidence in navigating health systems.

Reaching adolescent couples requires different approaches than reaching women who have already established health system relationships. It requires meeting young people where they are—at schools, at community gatherings, in conversations with peers—rather than at health facilities where they may feel out of place. It requires using communication channels that adolescents trust: peer health educators, community youth groups, social media where it is accessible, radio programming aimed specifically at young people's health questions.

The Nivaran Foundation's youth-focused reproductive health programs have found that when young men are included in reproductive health conversations rather than excluded from them—when male partners are engaged as stakeholders in healthy pregnancy outcomes rather than ignored as irrelevant to women's health—both knowledge and protective behavior improve. Men who understand the danger signs of pregnancy complications do something their partners cannot always do alone: they advocate for care-seeking when their partner's instinct may be to manage quietly at home. Love, operationalized as informed advocacy, is protecting her every time a young husband insists that the warning signs his reproductive health education taught him to recognize require immediate medical attention.
