The paddy fields in June are beautiful. The rice is young and bright green, standing in water that reflects the sky. To walk in these fields is to walk through one of the most productive agricultural landscapes in South Asia. It is also to walk through some of the most dangerous terrain for a particular kind of medical emergency: snakebite.

Nepal's Terai districts host several species of highly venomous snakes—including the common krait, the Russell's viper, and the Indian cobra—that inhabit exactly the agricultural and forest-edge environments where rural communities live and work. Snakebite is not a rare event here. It is a predictable seasonal emergency, peaking in June through September when agricultural work intensifies and snakes are most active. It is, in the clinical literature, accurately described as a neglected tropical disease—neglected not because it is rare but because it primarily affects poor, rural populations whose health emergencies receive less systematic attention than conditions affecting more visible populations.

The mortality and morbidity from snakebite in Nepal is substantial. People die from untreated or inadequately treated envenomation. Those who survive often do so with permanent disability—limb amputations from tissue necrosis, kidney failure from viper venom, neurological damage from neurotoxic species. The tragedy is compounded because effective antivenom exists. The treatment is not complex. The barrier is access.

Antivenom is expensive. It requires refrigeration. It must be administered by someone trained in its use, with capacity to manage anaphylactic reactions. It must be available at the right time—within hours of a bite for optimal effectiveness, before the venom has caused irreversible damage.

In the Terai districts where Nivaran Foundation works, the supply chain for antivenom is unreliable. Some health facilities maintain stock. Others run out and wait weeks for resupply. The facilities with reliable stock may be far from where bites occur. A farmer bitten in a remote field at dawn may not reach a facility with antivenom until afternoon—by which time the venom has done substantial damage.

The foundation's research identified the cascade of system failures that converts a treatable snakebite into a preventable death. Recognition is sometimes the first gap: traditional beliefs about snakebite treatment lead families to attempt local remedies first, delaying the journey to medical care. Transport is the second gap: carrying an envenomated person from a field or forest to a medical facility takes time, and the terrain may make it difficult. Antivenom availability is the third gap: reaching a facility only to find it out of stock transforms the journey from treatment to referral, adding more delay. And facility capacity is the fourth gap: even facilities with antivenom may lack staff trained in its administration or in managing complications.

Each gap adds delay. And in snakebite, delay is synonymous with damage. The venom does not pause while the systems fail.

The Nivaran Foundation's approach to snakebite addresses each gap. On recognition: working with communities to replace harmful traditional first-aid practices with evidence-based approaches—keeping the patient calm and still, immobilizing the affected limb, transporting immediately to a medical facility. On transport: pre-establishing transport networks so that bitten patients can be moved quickly, and training community members in transport techniques that minimize movement of the affected limb. On antivenom availability: working with district health systems to ensure consistent stock at facilities accessible to high-risk communities, and establishing protocols for transport of patients when local stock is absent.

The foundation has also worked on data collection: documenting where bites occur, when they occur, which species are responsible, and what delays in treatment are experienced. This data supports advocacy for improved resource allocation—ensuring that antivenom is prioritized in the facilities most likely to encounter it, not just in hospitals in district capitals.

The grass is hiding a killer—but the killer is not just the snake. It is the system failure that converts a treatable emergency into a preventable death. The snake is biology. The system failure is a choice—or more precisely, a series of choices about where to invest, what to prioritize, and whose medical emergencies deserve reliable treatment. Until those choices change, the Terai's paddy fields will continue to be beautiful in June and dangerous for exactly the people whose labor makes them productive.

The Nivaran Foundation has also worked on the psychosocial dimension of snakebite—an aspect that receives minimal attention in clinical literature but significant attention from community members who have experienced it. Snakebite survivors frequently develop fear responses to agricultural work: anxiety about returning to the fields where they were bitten, hypervigilance about ground-level movement that can impair work efficiency, and nightmares and intrusive memories that disrupt sleep. In communities where agricultural work is the primary livelihood, these psychological responses are economically as well as emotionally significant.

Simple psychological first aid after snakebite—acknowledgment that fear responses are normal, graduated return to work activities, community support during the recovery period—can significantly reduce the duration and severity of these post-bite psychological impacts. The foundation has trained community health workers in these basic psychological support techniques, recognizing that the clinical management of snakebite does not end when the antivenom is administered. It continues through the recovery period and into the psychological restoration of a person's relationship with the work environment where the bite occurred.

The grass will always hide potential threats in Nepal's agricultural districts. This is unchangeable. What is changeable is whether the people working in that grass have reliable access to the treatment that converts a potentially fatal encounter into a survivable one, and whether the health system supports their complete recovery—physical and psychological—in its aftermath. The snakebite is not merely a clinical event. It is a community event with ripples that extend far beyond the initial medical management. Health systems that treat it as only a clinical event miss most of what the affected person actually needs.

The socioeconomic dimensions of snakebite extend beyond the immediate medical emergency. Lost labor — often during planting or harvest season — can devastate a smallholder family's annual income. Treatment costs, including transport, anti-venom, and hospital stays, routinely push households below the poverty line. Agricultural workers earn approximately 800 to 1,200 Nepali rupees per day; a single hospitalization can consume months of savings. Without social protection mechanisms — income replacement, medical subsidies, or insurance coverage — the aftermath of a bite can be as economically lethal as the venom itself. The Nivaran Foundation's case management model explicitly includes economic recovery counseling, connecting families with local relief funds and cooperative credit schemes to help them rebuild.

Snakebite is categorized by the World Health Organization as a neglected tropical disease, a classification that carries both funding implications and political weight. Nepal's inclusion in global NTD elimination frameworks has begun to shift how the government budgets for anti-venom stockpiles and training. But classification alone does not save lives — implementation does. The Nivaran Foundation works directly with provincial health ministries to monitor stock levels, coordinate procurement, and train rural health workers in the administration of anti-venom. Until every health post within a day's journey of high-risk agricultural zones has both the medicine and the trained personnel to use it, snakebite will remain a death sentence for those who cannot reach a city hospital in time.
