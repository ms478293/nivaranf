Mahesh Paudel cannot drive on the ridge road above Pokhara anymore. He tried, a year after his sister died in the aviation accident that killed 68 people near the city in January 2023. The moment he smelled aviation fuel residue, his pulse accelerated so violently he had to pull over. His hands were shaking. He had to call his wife to drive him home.

This is not a dramatic response. This is what unprocessed trauma looks like translated into the body's learned defensive reflex. A smell becomes a threat signal. A ridge becomes a place of danger. A person who had flown safely his entire life becomes someone whose nervous system no longer trusts the sky.

Mahesh is one of thousands of people across Pokhara and surrounding districts whose lives were fundamentally altered by trauma that received intensive media attention for approximately three weeks and then, predictably, disappeared from news cycles. But Mahesh did not recover in three weeks. The nightmares and the avoidance and the moments when his son mentioned flying and he felt panic rise in his throat—these persisted month after month, becoming something that looked less like acute grief and more like a chronic condition.

This is the gap that Nivaran Foundation has begun documenting with increasing urgency: the disconnect between media-intensive crisis response and the long-term mental health needs that persist after cameras leave. Aviation disasters receive attention because they are dramatic. But the psychological aftermath—distributed across thousands of people who lost someone, witnessed something, or simply developed new fear responses—receives attention only in moments when it creates new headline-worthy crises.

The health coordinator Deepak had been trained in basic psychological first aid and trauma-informed care. He was not a psychiatrist. He was a community-based health worker who understood that first responders, families of deceased passengers, and even children who lived near the crash site needed support but often did not know where to seek it or how to acknowledge that they needed it.

'In the immediate aftermath, people get attention,' Deepak explained. 'Journalists come. Relief organizations arrive. Counselors offer services. There is immediate structure. But then that attention ends. People are expected to simply recover on their own. We noticed families did not seek help because they thought everyone else was fine, so their own distress seemed abnormal.'

This is a documented pattern in disaster psychology: survivors often isolate with their trauma, assuming that others have recovered, creating a self-perpetuating cycle where no one accesses support because everyone assumes everyone else is okay.

Nivaran approached the problem differently. Rather than waiting for people to self-identify and come to a clinic, health workers conducted community-based counseling—organizing what Deepak called 'listening circles' where affected families could gather, often separated by affiliation, and discuss their experience with trained listeners.

In one circle with first responders—soldiers and police who had spent weeks searching for remains in difficult terrain—a soldier named Ram began speaking about finding fragments of remains, how the smell had embedded in his clothes, how he could not eat properly for weeks afterward. 'I thought this was weakness,' Ram said quietly. 'That if I was a strong person, I would just move forward. But I could not move forward because my body remembered everything. I got angry at things that did not matter. I startled at sudden sounds. I thought I was broken.'

What Deepak did in that moment—naming that traumatic responses are normal, that physiological changes after witnessing death are expected rather than pathological—was not new to trauma science. But it was radically new to most of the people in that room, who had operated under the assumption that admitting difficulty meant admitting failure.

Mahesh's wife, Sanjana, described what happened to their household in the months after the accident: 'He could not sleep. He would wake up gasping. He stopped going to work because he could not manage being around other people's normalcy. I thought he should just accept death, move on. But then I realized he could not move on because his nervous system was still treating the disaster as an ongoing threat.'

The intervention Nivaran provided was straightforward but crucial: explaining trauma responses, validating what Mahesh was experiencing, providing practical guidance on symptom management and when clinical referral was necessary, and creating a pathway for ongoing support. 'The framework changed for me,' Mahesh said. 'Instead of thinking I was broken and needed to fix myself, I understood that my body was doing exactly what it was supposed to do—protecting me from danger. And if my body had learned that as a protective strategy, I could help my body learn something different.'

The data Nivaran collected showed consistent patterns: families who received support in the first three to six months after the disaster showed better long-term psychological outcomes. But Nivaran also documented something more systemic: none of this support would have happened through standard government health infrastructure. There was no system for identifying people in psychological distress after a disaster. There was no training in basic psychological first aid for community health workers. There was no budget allocation for trauma support in remote areas.

'We could not have done this at scale,' Deepak told the Foundation. 'A disaster in a remote district? There would be zero mental health support. People would manage their trauma alone and intergenerational effects would compound.' Mahesh, looking back on his journey, summarized what made the difference: 'The help was simple. Someone explained what was happening in my body in a way that made sense. Someone acknowledged that this was real and normal. That is all it took to change how I moved through it.'

The long-term follow-up data that Nivaran Foundation collected from the Pokhara community eighteen months after beginning their mental health intervention revealed patterns that support investment in sustained psychological support after disasters. Families who participated in listening circles and received some form of ongoing support showed measurably lower rates of what the foundation classified as 'functional impairment'—defined as significant disruption to work, relationships, or daily activities attributable to psychological distress. Families who received no support showed impairment rates approximately three times higher.

Perhaps more importantly, the children in supported households showed better indicators of resilience and academic re-engagement than children in unsupported households. Children are not separate from the psychological environment of their families. When parents are managing untreated trauma, children experience the effects through disrupted household routines, reduced parental attention and responsiveness, and exposure to adult distress. Supporting parents psychologically is, simultaneously, a childhood development intervention.

The Nivaran Foundation's case for sustained, community-based mental health support after disasters rests ultimately on a simple observation: if we would never expect a broken bone to heal without physical medicine, why do we expect psychological wounds to heal without psychological support? The expectation that communities will simply recover from major trauma without intervention reflects a misunderstanding of how trauma works in the nervous system and in social networks. Trauma does not resolve through time alone. It resolves through processing, connection, and meaning-making—processes that supported communities can engage in, and that unsupported communities often cannot. The cameras have moved on. The work continues.
