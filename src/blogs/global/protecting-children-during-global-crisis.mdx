The Gaza Strip has endured significant turmoil, especially following the conflict that began in October 2023. Reports indicate that over 46,600 Palestinians lost their lives, with more than half being women, children, or the elderly <Link href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-has-israels-gaza-offensive-killed-2025-01-15" className="text-primary-main">(Reuters)</Link>. The extensive destruction of infrastructure, including homes and schools, has left countless children homeless and deprived of education. The psychological trauma inflicted on these young minds is immeasurable, with many witnessing the loss of family members and friends.

Between July and September 2023, the United Nations documented at least 400 grave violations against children in Afghanistan.

In 2024, Haiti faced escalating crises, with armed gangs controlling significant territories. This instability has severely impacted children, exposing them to violence, displacement, and a lack of basic necessities <Link href="https://www.worldvision.org/about-us/media-center/world-vision-highlights-2024s-most-devastating-humanitarian-crises" className="text-primary-main">(World Vision)</Link>.
