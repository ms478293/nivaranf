She fasts twice a week, every week, throughout the year. The fasting is religious—it has deep meaning in her faith, connecting her to spiritual practice, communal identity, and ancestral tradition. The fasts are not casual omissions of meals. They are genuine periods of food restriction that can last eighteen to twenty-four hours. They are meaningful to her and to her community. They are, in her understanding, an important part of who she is.

She is also pregnant. And she is anemic. And she lives in a district where women's nutrition is already inadequate, where iron-deficiency anemia affects more than fifty percent of pregnant women, where the margin between adequate and dangerously insufficient nutrition is measured in the thinness of daily caloric intake.

This is the situation that Nivaran Foundation's health workers encounter regularly in the hill districts of Nepal: women whose religious practices intersect with nutritional vulnerability in ways that create genuine health risks. The religious practices are meaningful and sincere. The nutritional risks are real and measurable. The question—how to provide health guidance that respects religious practice while addressing genuine health risk—has no simple answer.

The wrong approach, unfortunately, is common. Health workers arrive and tell women that fasting is dangerous, that they must eat during pregnancy, that religious practice must yield to medical advice. Women nod, leave, and continue their practice. The health worker's advice was given. The health worker's advice was not followed. The anemia continues. The pregnancy progresses under nutritional conditions that increase risk.

The wrong approach fails because it treats the religious practice as an obstacle to health rather than as a dimension of personhood that must be integrated with health guidance. Women who have fasted for decades, whose mothers and grandmothers fasted, who find deep meaning in the practice, will not abandon it because a health worker tells them that nutrition is important. The advice competes with a lifetime of practice and belief. The advice loses.

The Nivaran Foundation's approach begins from a different premise: the religious practice is not something to overcome but something to work with. The health workers start from curiosity rather than judgment. What does the fast involve? What can be consumed during the fast? What breaks the fast, and with what foods? Are there religious exceptions for pregnant women or for illness? What do the women themselves understand about the intersection of fasting and pregnancy health?

These questions reveal something that the prescriptive approach misses: most religious traditions have internal mechanisms for managing health exceptions. Pregnancy is often a recognized exception to fasting requirements in many faiths. Illness typically provides grounds for adjustment. The religious tradition itself often contains flexibility that health workers can engage with rather than fight against.

The foundation's health workers have worked with community religious leaders and older women who carry religious knowledge to understand what exceptions exist, how they can be invoked, and what the cultural process for invoking them looks like. This creates a pathway where a pregnant woman with significant anemia can adjust her fasting practice in a way that feels religiously legitimate rather than religiously compromised—where she is following her faith's own provisions for circumstances like hers rather than abandoning her faith to follow medical advice.

Beyond exceptions, the health workers have worked on intensifying nutrition during non-fasting periods. If a woman will fast two days a week, the goal becomes ensuring that the remaining five days are nutritionally dense enough to compensate. This is not always possible with available foods and economic resources, but it becomes the focus: making the non-fasting periods as nutritionally rich as possible. Iron-rich foods, vitamin C to enhance iron absorption, caloric density during eating periods—these become the conversation, rather than a futile argument against fasting.

The foundation has also worked to ensure that the full range of nutritional support available—iron supplementation, fortified foods through government programs, nutrition support during pregnancy—reaches these women in ways that integrate with their practices. Iron supplementation should be timed to be taken with food, which means timing that fits with non-fasting periods. Nutritional counseling should acknowledge fasting and plan around it rather than ignoring it.

The result is not perfect. Anemia in fasting pregnant women remains higher than the foundation would like. But the approach that integrates with religious practice achieves better outcomes than the approach that opposes it. Women who feel respected in their faith are more likely to engage with health guidance. Women who receive advice that fits their lives rather than demanding impossible changes are more likely to act on that advice. The strength of her fast—the genuine commitment and meaning behind the practice—does not have to be in opposition to the strength of her body during pregnancy. Finding the way to honor both is the work.

The challenge of nutrition during religious fasting extends beyond pregnancy to include adolescent girls—a group the Nivaran Foundation has identified as particularly vulnerable to nutritional deficiency during fasting periods because their bodies are simultaneously growing, managing the nutritional demands of menstruation, and in some cases doing heavy agricultural or domestic labor. An adolescent girl who fasts for eighteen to twenty-four hours twice a week throughout the year may be maintaining a cumulative caloric and micronutrient deficit that affects her development in ways that persist into adulthood.

The foundation's approach with adolescent girls follows similar principles to its approach with pregnant women: begin from the existing practice, find the flexibility within it, and build nutritional density around the non-fasting periods rather than attacking the fasting periods directly. With adolescent girls, this includes ensuring school meals are nutritionally dense on non-fasting days, providing micronutrient supplementation that can be taken with food during eating periods, and working with schools and families to understand when girls are most nutritionally vulnerable and how to compensate.

The principle that emerges from all of this work—with pregnant women, with adolescent girls, with elderly community members managing fasting during health-compromised periods—is the same: health guidance that ignores the cultural and spiritual dimensions of food fails the people it is designed to serve. Food is never just nutrition. It is identity, relationship, meaning, and connection. Health workers who understand this and work within it, rather than against it, achieve outcomes that nutritional science alone never could.
