In rural Nepal, schools do not just educate children. They feed them. And in the middle of winter, when the temperature drops and transportation becomes difficult, this dual function reveals itself to be fragile—and its fragility carries consequences that outlast the weather.

On December 15, 2025, the government issued the notification that schools in five districts would close due to cold weather. Parents received notices. Teachers were told not to report. Classrooms that had been warm centers of activity became empty buildings. For wealthy families, this was an inconvenience. Children stayed home, parents adjusted schedules, and the week passed. But for families at the margin—families where a parent's salary was uncertain, where food security was monthly rather than guaranteed, where every day's nutrition had been carefully calculated—the school closure triggered something different: a crisis.

The Nivaran Foundation had been documenting the health impacts of winter school closures for three years. The 2025-2026 closure in five districts provided an opportunity to track the specific impacts in real time. What they found was an invisible crisis: the sudden removal of the reliable nutrition that vulnerable children depended on, compounded by the invisible costs of closure that persisted long after schools reopened.

A mother of three children described her closure-period strategy with the precision of someone who had learned to manage scarcity: 'One lighter meal in the morning, tea in the afternoon, and a shared evening meal after work.' She was not experimenting. She had calculated exactly what her household food budget could support. During normal school days, two of her children ate at school—a midday meal provided through the government nutritional program. Those two meals per day were resources she did not have to find at home. When the school closed, those two meal slots disappeared from her calculation. She now had three children to feed for three meals per day, using a budget that had been designed for one meal per child on school days.

She made the adjustment by reducing meal portions. She added tea and water to make meals appear larger than they were. She shifted to less expensive foods. But the reduction in caloric intake, especially for her youngest child who was already considered underweight, was immediate and measurable. By the time the school reopened, the child had lost weight. It would take three months of regular nutrition to recover what was lost in the three weeks of closure.

What Nivaran's documentation revealed was that the impact of school closures extends across multiple dimensions of child health. The most obvious was nutritional. Children receiving free meals at school were suddenly removed from that program. Families stretched budgets that were already tight. Some children began eating only once per day. But the impact extended beyond nutrition. Schools also provided other structural health support: teachers monitored for illness and provided basic first aid, schools had vaccination records and ensured children stayed current with immunizations, and schools provided a space where children exercised and moved—important in winter months when home environments often meant staying inside for weeks.

Teachers interviewed by the Foundation reported a secondary effect that emerged after longer closures: some children did not return to school when classes resumed. The closure had disrupted their attendance. Parents, facing the need to use children for household labor—collecting water, caring for younger siblings, assisting with seasonal work—had begun to see the school absence as an opportunity. They did not consciously decide to remove children from school permanently. But once the closure had broken the routine, the momentum toward return weakened.

One teacher described the pattern she had observed over years of winter closures: 'Five families do not send their children back. That is what we find each spring. The closure breaks the routine. When it is time to return, they keep their children home.' She had observed this pattern enough times to know that the visible cost of closures—the three weeks of missed school—was not the actual cost. The actual cost was the families lost, the children who moved from school to permanent dropout, the educational trajectories that shifted during a closure and never shifted back.

But the most important insight from the Nivaran Foundation's investigation was how the effects compounded. A child who loses weight during school closure does not recover quickly. A child who starts working during the closure does not stop working once school reopens. A child who misses vaccination updates faces health risks that persist for months. A child who gets behind in school work and experiences academic failure loses motivation that takes years to rebuild. These are not three-week impacts. They are impacts that persist for months and years, creating cascading health and educational disadvantages that follow a single school closure.

The solution the Foundation proposed was not just about keeping schools open. It was about creating parallel systems that activate when schools close. The strategy required coordinated action across nutrition, health, and social protection systems: activating nutrition continuity plans immediately when school closures are announced, providing take-home rations for children who would normally receive meals at school. It meant ensuring that health services continue during closures, establishing temporary clinics in communities where schools are closed. It meant providing community support activities during closures, and monitoring the transition back to school carefully.

The Nivaran Foundation's investigation into school closures revealed something that cold-weather closures do not acknowledge: in a system where some families have secure food sources and others do not, a closure that breaks the routine of school meals disrupts inequality. It pushes vulnerable children across a line from marginal stability to inadequate nutrition. And if the closure is long enough, and if families adjust their economic plans during it, the children sometimes do not cross back.

The research also revealed a particularly troubling pattern among school-age girls. When household food budgets tightened during school closures, girls' food intake was reduced before boys'—a reflection of entrenched gender norms that prioritize male nutrition in contexts of scarcity. Girls who already faced nutritional disadvantages in normal times experienced compounded disadvantage during closures. This means that school meal programs are not just nutritional interventions but equity interventions: they partially offset the gender bias in household food distribution by ensuring girls receive a reliable, adequate meal regardless of household priority.

Health workers who visited households during the 2025-2026 school closure period documented something that standard closure impact assessments miss: the psychological dimension. Children who were accustomed to the structure, social engagement, and purpose of school experienced the abrupt closure as disorienting. Anxiety increased. Sleep patterns disrupted. Behavioral changes—increased irritability, withdrawal—appeared within the first week. These psychological impacts are not trivial. They affect learning readiness when schools reopen and can, in children already living in stressful environments, trigger mental health responses that persist long after the physical closure ends.

The Nivaran Foundation's policy recommendation emerging from this analysis is specific: winter school closures in Nepal should be accompanied by automatic activation of nutrition continuity plans. These plans already exist on paper for some districts. The gap is activation—the trigger mechanism that says when closure is declared, these specific actions begin simultaneously: take-home ration distribution activates within 48 hours, health outreach visits to vulnerable households increase, community monitoring of at-risk children intensifies. Until closure and continuity are linked by automatic activation rather than ad hoc response, the nutritional harm of closures will continue to accumulate in exactly the children least able to absorb it.
