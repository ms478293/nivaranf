The curfew order came at 3 p.m. on January 8, 2026. Starting at 6 p.m., movement would be restricted in Birgunj. No vehicles were to be on the roads. Essential services were exempted, but the definition was unclear and enforcement was likely to be strict. Health facilities had twelve hours to understand what 'essential services' meant, communicate that to ambulance drivers, and establish protocols that security forces would recognize and allow.

The Nivaran Foundation was not focused on the politics that had led to the curfew. Their concern was immediate and practical: when roads are closed for political reasons, patients still have medical emergencies. The hospital did not close. The patients did not stop having strokes, heart attacks, complicated pregnancies, or severe infections. But transport—the only way to move those patients from home or outlying clinics to hospital—became impossible.

This created a specific kind of medical crisis. Not from lack of capability, but from lack of access. A patient having a stroke is time-critical. The window for intervention is hours. If transport becomes impossible during that window, the patient does not get treatment. Another patient needing dialysis has a scheduled appointment. If roads are closed, they miss the appointment. Miss enough dialysis sessions and the patient deteriorates. A pregnant woman with signs of eclampsia needs immediate transfer to hospital. If roads are closed, that transfer cannot happen.

In the first hours of the curfew, the Nivaran Foundation documented what happened. Some health facilities had pre-arranged understanding with security forces that ambulances could move. These facilities continued transferring patients. Others did not have that arrangement and had to make impossible decisions: keep patients at the facility without capability to manage them, or risk sending ambulances that might be stopped.

One case captured the absurdity: a child with severe gastroenteritis had developed profound dehydration despite IV fluids started at a primary clinic. The child needed blood work, electrolyte management, possible hospitalization. The clinic was equipped for neither. The hospital capable of managing the case was ten kilometers away—a normal drive of fifteen minutes. But the roads were closed. The facility called the hospital. The hospital said they would admit the child if the child could arrive. But nobody could move the child safely through roads where traffic was being stopped. The facility eventually sent the ambulance. The ambulance was stopped once. The driver had to negotiate passage. The delay added two hours to what should have been a fifteen-minute journey. The child eventually reached hospital. But the case revealed something: health access does not depend just on hospitals existing or clinicians being trained. It depends on physical movement being possible.

The Nivaran Foundation's response included practical steps: working with district health authorities to establish formal protocols recognizing health vehicles as essential services and providing documentation that security forces could recognize. They established communication protocols so that dispatchers could confirm with security that vehicles were responding to medical emergencies. They worked with health facilities to clarify decision-making: which cases required immediate referral regardless of transport restrictions, and which cases could wait until roads reopened. And they worked with community health workers to strengthen local stabilization capacity.

But the Foundation's analysis also revealed something about health systems during civic disruption: the impact is not equal. Low-income patients and low-income areas are most affected. A wealthy family whose pregnant woman developed complications could arrange private transport through political connections. A poor family had to hope that ambulances could navigate closed roads.

One health worker at a peripheral clinic described the pattern: 'When roads are closed, the wealthy find ways to move. They have connections. The poor wait. And while they wait, their condition changes.' This worker was not making a political statement. She was describing medical reality.

The Nivaran Foundation's longer-term analysis proposed something broader: health access must be explicitly protected as essential during civic disruption. This required formal protocols that every security authority recognizes—health vehicles moving patients in emergency condition are not subject to movement restrictions. This is not arbitrary favor. It is a societal principle: health care access is one of the few services that must remain active under almost all circumstances. It required training and coordination between health and security sectors so that the protocol is understood and implemented consistently. And it required resilience in health systems so that if some routes become impossible, alternative routes exist.

The curfew in Birgunj lasted three days. During those three days, the Nivaran Foundation estimated that approximately forty patients requiring transfer experienced delays. One elderly man with heart disease did not receive treatment during the optimal window and suffered permanent cardiac damage that could have been prevented. One woman in early labor could not access hospital delivery and had complications that affected her baby. These were not theoretical harms. These were real people whose medical outcomes were damaged because transport became impossible.

The deeper lesson was about what health equity looks like during civic disruption. It means that a patient in a marginalized area experiencing a medical emergency has roughly equal chances of reaching care as a patient in a wealthy area. It means that civic disruption does not become an opportunity for health inequity to widen. The mother of the child with severe dehydration eventually said something important: 'When roads close for politics, the body does not agree to wait. The body gets worse on its own schedule, not on the schedule of politics.' This is the fundamental principle that health systems must operate from during civic disruption.

The foundation's analysis also documented what happens to healthcare worker decision-making during civic disruptions that close roads. Medical providers, unable to transfer patients who needed higher-level care, faced the impossible position of managing conditions beyond their facility's capacity. Some improvised effectively—stabilizing patients with available resources, stretching protocols, making do. Others described the psychological burden of knowing that a patient needed care they could not provide while transport was unavailable. Several described delaying documentation of clinical deterioration because they feared the documentation would appear as negligence when in fact it was circumstance.

This documentation-delaying behavior—which appeared in multiple interviews across different facilities during the civic disruption period—represents a systemic failure that extends beyond the disruption itself. When providers face legal and professional liability for outcomes they could not control, they make decisions that protect themselves rather than illuminate reality. Documentation that should clearly state 'patient deteriorated because transport was unavailable' instead becomes ambiguous. This ambiguity prevents accurate accounting of the health impact of civic disruptions, which in turn prevents adequate policy response. The Nivaran Foundation advocates for formal 'force majeure' documentation protocols that allow clinicians to accurately record when outcomes were determined by system failures rather than clinical errors.

The broader lesson from the ambulance crisis during civic disruption is this: health systems cannot be designed only for the conditions that exist when political stability is high, roads are open, and all assumptions hold. They must be designed with explicit acknowledgment that assumptions will sometimes fail. A health system that functions only when everything else functions is not a health system that can be relied upon. Building true resilience means anticipating the full range of conditions—bad weather, infrastructure failure, civic disruption, natural disaster—and ensuring that core health functions can continue even when surrounding conditions become unpredictable.
