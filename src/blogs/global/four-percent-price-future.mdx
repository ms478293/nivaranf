In the hills outside Kathmandu, in a small government school serving three villages, a teacher named Shreya keeps a notebook filled with urgent arithmetic that never balances. She writes down which children came to school hungry that week. She notes whose growth, measured in early September, has not improved by spring. She tracks when her students' ability to concentrate visibly dims—usually by the second week after household resources tighten, when stored grain runs low and market prices spike.

'The money exists to change this,' Shreya said, opening that notebook to reveal meticulous documentation of preventable patterns. 'The problem is we spend money everywhere except where it matters most.'

Her observation captures the central crisis the Nivaran Foundation has been documenting with increasing urgency: Nepal allocates only four percent of its social protection budget directly to children, despite evidence from across South Asia showing that early childhood investment returns multiples of its cost within a single generation. This is not a debate about sentiment or childhood development psychology. It is simple arithmetic disguised as policy.

The 'four percent' figure haunts policy corridors because it represents a choice, not a constraint. When a nine-year-old girl cannot read at grade level despite attending school, or a five-year-old boy shows stunting that will limit his height and cognition for life, these are not random failures. They are consequences of budget decisions made by people who see nutrition, early learning, and preventive health not as investments but as consumption—as something nice to fund if resources permit, rather than foundational infrastructure upon which everything else depends.

Radha, a mother of four in Janakpur district, worked in the fields right up until labor—not because she wanted to, but because the household needed her income every single day. When her youngest, Amar, was born at 2.4 kilograms, the health worker noted it and explained the importance of early nutrition. But explanation without resources is the most common form of cruelty in rural healthcare. 'The nurse said he should eat more of this, more of that,' Radha recalled. 'She did not understand that eating more was not my choice. I could only give him what we had.'

Amar reached eighteen months old without the complementary foods—the eggs, the oil, the micronutrient-rich vegetables—that his body needed to wire his brain, build muscle, and strengthen immunity. By the time a Nivaran field coordinator visited and connected Radha with a supplementation program, Amar had already missed the most critical window of neural development. He survived, but the window closed. The consequences will compound across every year of his life.

This is what the 'four percent' means translated into human terms. It means that Nepal spends vastly more managing the adult consequences of childhood deprivation than preventing deprivation in the first place. It means that a child born in a remote district faces odds of stunting almost triple those of a child born in Kathmandu—not because of biology, but because of budget allocation. It means that Shreya must watch capable children's potential atrophy every year because the resources that could prevent it are allocated elsewhere.

The Nivaran Foundation's policy director reviewed comparative data from across South Asian countries. The statistics were striking: countries allocating even eight to ten percent of social protection budgets to direct child-focused programs showed measurable improvements in stunting, school attendance, and cognitive development within five years. Yet these countries started from the same resource constraints as Nepal.

'The question is not whether Nepal can afford to invest in children,' the director said quietly. 'It is whether Nepal can afford the consequences of not doing so. When a child misses early nutrition, we do not save money—we just shift costs forward. We pay when that child fails in school. We pay when teenagers do not develop the cognitive capacity for skilled work. We pay when entire regions underperform economically because human capital never developed.'

In a cluster of villages in Humla district, Nivaran introduced a nutrition supplementation program for pregnancies and children under two, combined with targeted school feeding and anemia prevention. The changes appeared within eighteen months. The most recent cohort of kindergarten children showed better height-for-age. School attendance improved, particularly among girls. Teacher reports of hunger-related concentration problems dropped noticeably.

The Foundation proposes what it calls a 'protected child-impact floor'—a mandatory allocation threshold ensuring that at least twelve percent of social protection budgets go directly to early childhood interventions, with clear outcome tracking on nutrition, school attendance, and health indicators. This is not new money. It is reallocation based on evidence about what actually prevents lifelong harm.

The arithmetic of childhood deprivation compounds relentlessly. A child who is stunted has reduced cognitive capacity, lower school performance, and fewer job opportunities. That child earns roughly twenty percent less across her lifetime. She is more likely to have her own children early and with health risks, creating intergenerational transmission of poverty. The 'four percent' budget allocation to children ultimately becomes a decision about whether Nepal's future economic capacity matters less than simpler budget politics today.

Shreya stood watching her students at morning assembly—forty children standing in the sunlight, singing the national anthem. About half showed visible signs of malnutrition, that particular thinness that comes not from starvation but from chronic inadequacy. 'These children will be adults making decisions in twenty years,' she said. 'The question is what kind of adults we are making, and whether we have the economic sense to see that as the most important budget decision Nepal makes.'

The international evidence on early childhood investment returns is robust and well-documented. Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman has demonstrated across decades of research that investments in early childhood yield the highest returns of any public investment—higher than education subsidies, higher than job training programs, higher than most infrastructure investments. The returns come through multiple pathways: better cognitive development leads to higher educational achievement, which leads to higher earnings, which leads to greater tax revenues and lower dependency on social support systems. The investment is not charity. It is economically rational at the national scale.

Yet this evidence has not translated into Nepal's budget allocation, and the Nivaran Foundation's analysis suggests why: early childhood investment is politically invisible. The beneficiaries—infants and toddlers—cannot vote. The returns materialize over decades, long after the politicians who made the investment have left office. The beneficiaries are disproportionately from the most marginalized communities, which have the least political voice. The investment requires crossing multiple administrative silos—health, education, social protection—which makes clear accountability difficult. Every structural feature of political economy pushes against allocating adequate resources to early childhood, even when the economic case is overwhelming.

What would change this calculus? The Nivaran Foundation argues for three things simultaneously. First, advocacy that translates the economic evidence into language that resonates with budget-makers—not as charity but as investment, not as spending but as asset creation. Second, outcome tracking that makes the cost of under-investment visible: tracking stunting rates, early childhood mortality, and developmental delays at the district level and reporting them publicly, creating political accountability for what is currently invisible harm. Third, building coalitions that include not just health advocates but economists, education experts, and private sector voices who understand that a stunted workforce is a constrained economic future. The four percent must change. The question is who will make the political case loudly enough and persistently enough to change it.
