## From Peace to Protest: GenZ Revolution Redefines Nepal’s Politics



In early September 2025, Nepal witnessed one of the most significant youth-led uprisings in its history, sparked by corruption, lack of transparency, nepotism, and taxes not being used properly for the nation. What began as peaceful protests for rights quickly escalated into bloodshed, as the people demanded nationwide action against corruption, nepotism, and decades of political stagnation. The movement, dubbed the GenZ Revolution, has reshaped Nepal’s political landscape and brought the frustrations of a restless generation to the forefront.

<BlogParagraph >
  <p>For the past decade, Nepal’s politics has been dominated by three leaders – K.P. Sharma Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda) – who have collectively served as prime minister 12 times, rotating power among themselves.Meanwhile, Nepal’s youth unemployment remains at 20%, and 33% of GDP relies on remittances from migrant workers abroad. This imbalance highlights the lack of domestic structural transformation, leaving many young people dependent on online platforms for income, education, and opportunities.Against this backdrop, growing resentment toward corruption, nepotism, and lack of accountability has long been simmering beneath the surface.</p>

  <p>The events of September 2025 revealed a generational rift in Nepalese politics. For years, entrenched leaders prioritized personal power over systemic reform, while young people struggled with unemployment, migration pressures, and corruption.</p><p>The GenZ Revolution is more than just a protest against a social media ban – it is a generational uprising demanding a new vision for Nepal, one rooted in transparency, accountability, and inclusion. Whether this marks the beginning of lasting reform or another chapter of instability remains to be seen.</p>
