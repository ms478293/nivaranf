Constitutions around the world enshrine the right to life as fundamental. It appears in international treaties and declarations. It is treated as foundational to human dignity. Yet for millions of people living in remote areas, this constitutional right remains largely theoretical. The right exists on paper. The enforcement of that right—the actual mechanisms that protect life—is far less certain.

A person living in rural Nepal who falls seriously ill faces a choice that people in urban areas rarely encounter: how to reach medical care. The path from symptom to treatment is obstructed by geography, poverty, and institutional failure. Distance separates home from the nearest healthcare facility. Transport costs create uncertainty and hardship. Weather and infrastructure problems make reliable arrival unpredictable. The constitutional right to life meets practical barriers that make it nearly impossible to exercise.

The Nivaran Foundation's work on healthcare access begins from the understanding that rights are only meaningful when they can be exercised. The right to life is meaningless for someone who cannot reach medical care. The right to education is meaningless for someone who cannot afford school fees. Rights exist in a relationship between constitutional promises and practical capacity. When the capacity does not exist, the right becomes an empty statement.

This has profound implications for how we think about health systems. We often frame healthcare provision as a charitable service or a government program. But from the perspective of rights, healthcare access should be understood as the enforcement of constitutional promises. A health system is the institutional mechanism through which societies fulfill their legal and moral commitment that citizens' lives will be protected.

Yet health systems in many low-income countries have been built with limited attention to whether they actually ensure access for people living in remote or economically marginalized areas. Infrastructure is concentrated in urban centers. Specialist services are available to those who can afford to travel. Rural areas are treated as secondary, receiving attention only if resources remain after serving more visible, more easily accessible populations.

The Nivaran Foundation's work has focused on building the infrastructure that would make the constitutional right to life practically meaningful for rural communities. This includes referral systems that work reliably—pathways where someone with a potentially serious illness knows where to go and how to get there. Transport support that removes the barrier of cost. Follow-up systems that ensure people do not fall through gaps between initial care and ongoing treatment. And pre-transport stabilization training—teaching community health workers to provide emergency care before a patient reaches a facility.

Work on referral coordination has involved connecting primary health facilities to secondary facilities that can provide more complex care. This means creating actual relationships between facilities, not just theoretical pathways. It means ensuring that when a patient is referred, the receiving facility knows they are coming and has capacity to receive them. It means following up to ensure that the referred patient actually reached the facility and received the care they needed.

The deeper question that the Nivaran Foundation raises is this: what does society owe its members? If a constitution guarantees the right to life, does that guarantee have meaning only for people who live near hospitals? Or does it extend to those whose geography has placed them far from medical services? If we believe it extends to everyone, then we have obligations. We have obligations to build systems that make healthcare access possible, even in remote areas. We have obligations to prioritize equity not as an afterthought but as foundational to how systems are designed.

This reframes the typical healthcare debate. Instead of asking 'how do we build better hospitals,' we should be asking 'how do we ensure that everyone in our nation can actually reach a hospital when they need one?' Instead of celebrating the existence of services, we should be measuring whether those services are actually accessible to all who need them.

The Nivaran Foundation's work on healthcare access is, in its deepest sense, work on democracy and human rights. It is work on making the promises that constitutions make actually meaningful for all members of society, not just for those fortunate enough to live in cities near medical centers. Until that work is complete, the right to life remains, for many, theoretical rather than practical. And a right that cannot be exercised is not a right at all.

The Nivaran Foundation has developed what it calls a 'rights-based accountability framework' for health system performance in remote areas. The framework begins from the constitutional right to life and asks three questions: first, is the care technically capable of protecting life in this district? Second, is that care accessible to all people in this district regardless of economic status and geographic location? Third, is the care delivered in a way that respects the dignity of patients?

Applying this framework to Nepal's rural health system reveals a consistent pattern: technical capability is present, but often inadequate; accessibility is compromised by geography, cost, and transport; and dignity is inconsistent, with some facilities providing respectful care and others perpetuating exactly the disrespect that drives women to choose home delivery. The framework is useful not primarily as a philosophical statement but as an accountability tool: by specifying what the right to life requires in operational terms, it creates a basis for measuring whether the right is being honored or violated.

The implementation of rights-based health accountability requires something that health systems are often reluctant to embrace: honest public reporting on failure. A rights-based system does not just celebrate its successes—the babies born safely, the vaccinations administered, the diseases treated. It publicly accounts for its failures—the preventable deaths that occurred because transport was unavailable, the patients turned away because medication was out of stock, the women who chose home delivery because health workers treated them disrespectfully. Honest failure reporting is politically difficult and institutionally uncomfortable. But it is the only mechanism that creates genuine pressure for improvement. Until health systems face accountability for the failures that the right to life demands be prevented, they will continue to optimize for political visibility rather than for health equity.
