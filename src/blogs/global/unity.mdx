  Building Healthcare Systems That Communities Own
</h1>

Project Unity is Nivaran Foundation's initiative to build lasting community health infrastructure across Nepal. While individual health camps save lives, sustainable health improvements require permanent systems: trained local health workers, equipped health posts, supply chains for essential medicines, and community organizations that take ownership of their own healthcare delivery.

Nivaran has conducted 304 health camps serving 61,200+ patients across 52 districts. Project Unity takes the next step by transforming these episodic interventions into permanent, community-owned healthcare systems. The goal is not to create dependency on external health camps, but to build local capacity so that communities can sustain quality healthcare on their own.

      Health camps save lives, but lasting change requires permanent systems.
      Project Unity is building the healthcare infrastructure that communities
      in Nepal need to take ownership of their own health outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the right support and collaboration, we can create a future where
      every community in Nepal has access to trained health workers, equipped
      facilities, and the organizational capacity to sustain quality healthcare.
