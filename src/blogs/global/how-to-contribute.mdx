## Your contribution is not abstract. It buys medicines, pays doctors, and opens schools. Here is what every amount makes possible.

    <p>
      At the Nivaran Foundation, we do not ask for donations without
      telling you exactly what they fund. Every dollar we receive goes
      toward specific, trackable outcomes in healthcare and education
      across Nepal. Here is what your contribution makes possible.
    </p>
    <h2>What Your Donation Funds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>$25 provides eye care screenings for 5 patients.</b> This
        covers vision testing, refraction assessments, and referrals for
        patients who need surgical follow-up. In rural Nepal, this is
        often the first eye exam these patients have ever received.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>$50 funds a full day of health camp operations.</b> This
        includes staffing, supplies, and logistics for one day of
        multi-specialty care, including dental, ENT, general medicine,
        and lab testing, in a single community.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>$100 provides essential medicines for 20 families.</b> This
        covers the pharmaceutical supplies distributed during health
        camps: antibiotics, pain management, chronic condition
        medications, and basic first-aid supplies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>$500 funds a complete health camp.</b> This covers the full
        cost of deploying a medical team to a rural municipality:
        transportation, equipment, medicines, patient registration,
        and community outreach for one camp serving up to 200 patients.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are not estimates. They are drawn from our actual cost
      structure under Phase I of Project Sanjeevani, our $18 million
      healthcare initiative covering 304 camps across 52 districts.
    </p>
    <h2>One-Time or Recurring: Both Matter</h2>
    <p>
      <b>One-time donations</b> provide immediate impact. They help us
      purchase supplies, deploy teams, and respond to the most urgent
      needs on the ground. If you want to fund a specific camp or
      contribute to a particular district, one-time giving lets you
      direct your support precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Monthly recurring donations</b> provide something equally
      important: predictability. When we know we have a steady base of
      monthly supporters, we can plan further ahead, commit to more
      camps, and ensure continuity of care for communities that depend
      on us. Even $10 per month adds up to $120 over a year, enough to
      provide medicines for 24 families.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="/donate"><b>Set up your donation here.</b></a> All
      contributions are tax-deductible under our 501(c)(3) status
      (EIN: 41-2656587).
    </p>
    <h2>Volunteer With Us</h2>
    <p>
      Not every contribution is financial. The Nivaran Foundation runs
      on the time and expertise of people who care about healthcare
      and education in Nepal. Here is how you can get involved:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Medical professionals:</b> If you are a doctor, nurse,
        dentist, or lab technician, you can join our health camp
        teams on the ground in Nepal. We coordinate volunteer
        deployments around our camp schedule.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Educators and trainers:</b> Project Vidya needs teachers,
        curriculum developers, and technology trainers to support
        our education programs in rural schools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skills-based volunteers:</b> From graphic design and
        communications to data analysis and event coordination, our
        operations in Boston and Kathmandu benefit from a wide range
        of professional skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Community fundraisers:</b> Organize a local event, run a
        social media campaign, or rally your workplace to support a
        specific health camp. We provide materials and support to
        help you tell our story.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      to discuss how your time and skills can make a difference.
    </p>
    <h2>In-Kind Donations</h2>
    <p>
      We accept donations of medical supplies, diagnostic equipment,
      educational materials, and other items that directly support our
      programs. If you or your organization has supplies to contribute,
      reach out to us first so we can confirm what is currently needed
      and coordinate logistics.
    </p>
    <h2>Leave a Lasting Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Planned giving through bequests and estate planning allows you to
      support the Nivaran Foundation's work for years beyond your
      lifetime. Project Sanjeevani spans over a decade, and legacy
      gifts help ensure that future phases, including permanent health
      centers and district hospitals, become a reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every form of support matters. Whether it is $25 for eye
      screenings or a week of your time volunteering at a health camp,
      your contribution directly improves lives in Nepal's most
      underserved communities.{" "}
