## In rural Nepal, the nearest doctor can be a two-day walk away. Project Sanjeevani brings the doctor to the village.

  <BlogParagraph>
    <p>
      Across Nepal's mountainous terrain and remote river valleys, millions
      of people live without reliable access to basic healthcare. In
      districts like Bajura, Humla, and Dolpa, there are fewer than two
      doctors per 10,000 people. Preventable conditions go undiagnosed.
      Treatable diseases become chronic. Eye problems that could be
      corrected with a simple screening lead to permanent vision loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project Sanjeevani exists to change that. It is the Nivaran
      Foundation's flagship healthcare initiative, and it is the largest
      commitment we have ever made.
    </p>
    <h2>The Scale of What We Are Building</h2>
    <p>
      Phase I of Project Sanjeevani (2025-2027) is an $18 million
      investment in mobile healthcare delivery across Nepal. The numbers
      tell the story:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>304 health camps</b> planned across 5 provinces</li>
      <li><b>52 districts</b> covered, reaching 252 municipalities</li>
      <li><b>61,200+ patients</b> targeted for screening and treatment</li>
      <li><b>24 technical medical teams</b> deployed simultaneously</li>
      <li><b>450,000 population</b> within the service coverage area</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each health camp operates as a fully equipped mobile clinic,
      staffed by specialists and supplied with diagnostic tools that
      most of these communities have never seen.
    </p>
    <h2>Five Specialties, One Camp</h2>
    <p>
      Every Sanjeevani health camp delivers a comprehensive suite of
      medical services. We do not run single-issue screenings. When our
      teams arrive in a village, they bring the capacity to address
      multiple health needs in a single visit:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Eye Care:</b> Vision screening, refraction testing, and
        referrals for surgical intervention. In rural Nepal, untreated
        cataracts and refractive errors are among the leading causes of
        preventable blindness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dental Care:</b> Oral examinations, basic treatments, and
        hygiene education. Many patients we serve have never visited a
        dentist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat):</b> Hearing assessments and
        treatment for chronic ear infections, which are widespread in
        high-altitude communities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>General Medicine:</b> Blood pressure and hypertension
        screening, chronic condition detection, physical examinations,
        and referrals for follow-up care.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lab Testing:</b> Blood tests, urine analysis, pulse
        oximetry, and portable X-ray and ultrasound imaging for
        on-site diagnostics.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Our Medical Teams</h2>
    <p>
      We deploy 24 technical teams composed of general practitioner
      doctors, ophthalmologists, dentists, ENT specialists, lab
      technicians, and community health workers. These teams rotate
      across districts on a structured schedule, ensuring consistent
      coverage across all five target provinces: Sudurpaschim, Karnali,
      Gandaki, Bagmati, and Koshi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each team carries standardized diagnostic equipment: lab kits,
      dental instruments, ophthalmic tools, portable imaging devices,
      and a full pharmacy of essential medicines. The goal is to make
      every camp self-sufficient so that no patient is turned away due
      to lack of supplies.
    </p>
    <h2>Beyond Phase I: A Long-Term Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Health camps are the starting point, not the endpoint. Project
      Sanjeevani is structured in four phases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Phase I (2025-2027):</b> 304 mobile health camps across 52 districts</li>
      <li><b>Phase II (2027-2029):</b> Establishing a permanent Nivaran Health Centers network</li>
      <li><b>Phase III (2027-2032):</b> Building 50-bed hospitals across 77 districts</li>
      <li><b>Phase IV (2032-2036):</b> A 700+ bed central hospital serving as a research, learning, and training hub</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The data we collect during Phase I, including patient demographics,
      disease prevalence, and community health profiles, will directly
      inform where we place permanent facilities in later phases.
    </p>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Nepal's healthcare infrastructure has improved in urban centers
      over the past two decades, but rural communities have been left
      behind. For families in districts like Bajura, Mugu, or Taplejung,
      a health camp is not a convenience. It is the only medical care
      they may receive all year.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not see this as charity. We see it as building the
      foundation for a healthcare system that serves everyone, not just
      those who live near a city.
