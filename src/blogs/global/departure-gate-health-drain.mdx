The buses line up at dawn outside the central transit station in Kathmandu. They are filled with men, mostly in their twenties and thirties, carrying small bags of belongings. They are heading to the airport. They are heading to Doha, Riyadh, Dubai—the Gulf countries where Nepali migrant workers contract to work in construction, domestic service, and hospitality. They are heading out, and what they are leaving behind is a hole in the health care capacity of their families.

This is January, the peak month for migration departures. Families have returned from their own migrations for Dashain and Tihar festivals. They have spent time with relatives. Now, as the festival season ends, working-age men begin leaving again for Gulf contracts. The Nivaran Foundation's research documented this annual cycle and its health impacts—impacts that are invisible in hospital statistics, invisible in disease surveillance, but visible in every clinic serving rural communities where working-age adults have departed for international employment.

A caregiver interviewed by the Foundation captured the mechanism with precision: 'When he is away, every health problem becomes my transport problem.' This sentence encodes the core insight: health access in rural Nepal depends not just on hospital availability but on household logistics. Someone has to arrange transport when a family member falls sick. Someone has to make decisions about whether to go to the hospital now or wait. Someone has to coordinate with neighbors for emergency support. These are not medical functions. They are logistical functions. And in many rural households, they fall to the migrant worker.

The husband of a sick woman described what happened during his absence: 'When I was here, if she felt weak, I would make the decision and we would go to the clinic. When I am gone, she hesitates. She thinks about cost. She thinks about finding transport. Sometimes the problem gets worse before she decides to go.' He was articulating something sophisticated: medical decisions made alone are different from medical decisions made in partnership. Having a partner who can confirm 'yes, we should go' provides confidence. Being alone with a decision makes hesitation more likely.

The Nivaran Foundation's documentation revealed a specific pattern: when working-age adults are absent, care-seeking delays increase. Not because knowledge changes, not because facilities become less available, but because household decision-making becomes more difficult. An elderly woman with chest pain hesitates to seek care because her son is absent and she does not want to burden her daughter-in-law. A child with persistent cough stays home longer because the mother, managing alone, waits longer before deciding 'this requires a clinic visit.' These delays do not seem dramatic. But across a population, they accumulate into detectable increases in disease complications.

The research also revealed something about who bears the burden of migration: it is disproportionately women. When men migrate, the caregiving functions they performed or enabled—transport support, medical decision-making partnership, household management—shift to women. Daughters-in-law, wives, and elderly mothers become the caregivers managing household health without their usual support. This creates a situation where women's workload increases dramatically while support decreases. In this context, preventive health behaviors—regular clinic visits for pregnancy monitoring, chronic disease management, immunizations—often get deprioritized because immediate household crises demand attention.

The Nivaran Foundation's deeper analysis revealed something about the timing of migration: it peaks exactly when household vulnerability is highest. January migration happens after the post-holiday food security period. By February and March, household food reserves are depleting. Then comes the lean season—March through May—when food stocks are minimal and new harvest has not begun. This is exactly when household-level health investments become most difficult. Yet this is exactly when migrant workers are absent.

The solution proposed by the Foundation was not to discourage migration—they understood that migration is economically necessary for many families. The solution was to make health systems explicitly migration-aware: intensive outreach during migration season peaks, seasonal distribution of health services, explicit recognition of single-household decision-making as a health risk factor, and integration with migration-related economic support.

In districts where the Nivaran Foundation has worked, patterns have shifted. Clinics have shifted to community locations during migration peaks, chronic disease supplies have been pre-positioned, and decision-making support is available. The buses still line up at dawn in Kathmandu. Working-age men still board them heading for six-month contracts. And the women left behind still navigate health decisions with reduced support. But the navigation is slightly easier—a recognition that health access is not evenly distributed across the year, and systems must adjust accordingly.

What the Nivaran Foundation discovered through systematic analysis of seasonal patterns was that the impact of migration on health access follows predictable cycles that health systems could plan for but largely do not. Migration peaks in January. Child illness rates for unaccompanied households peak in February and March. Emergency referrals from migrant households increase between April and June. These patterns repeat annually with remarkable consistency. Yet health system resource allocation—staffing levels, outreach schedules, medication stocks—does not adjust to account for them. The system is designed as if all months are equal when evidence clearly shows they are not.

Mobile clinic scheduling offers one direct response. By positioning mobile health services in communities with high migration rates during the periods of peak vulnerability—particularly February through May, when households are adjustment-depleted and seasonal illness is peaking—health systems can proactively bridge the support gap left by migrant absence. This requires flexibility that government health systems often lack. It requires the ability to shift resources seasonally, to move a health worker from a lower-need area to a higher-need area for a few months, to schedule outreach in communities that are harder to serve during the most difficult period rather than during the most convenient one.

The caregiver who said 'when he is away, every health problem becomes my transport problem' was articulating not just a personal challenge but a policy failure. She was describing a health system that was designed for a family structure that no longer exists in large swaths of rural Nepal. The two-parent household with shared decision-making capacity and shared transport responsibility is the assumption embedded in how health services are structured. But a substantial and growing proportion of rural households are effectively single-person managed, with the managing adult carrying alone the burdens that were previously shared. Until health systems acknowledge this reality and design services accordingly, migration will continue to function as an invisible driver of health inequity.
