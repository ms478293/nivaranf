The earthquake hit in Jajarkot district on November 3, 2023. It killed more than 150 people. It collapsed thousands of homes. International aid arrived within weeks. Coordinated rescue and recovery operations began immediately. By mid-November, the acute emergency was being declared over—the bodies had been recovered, the survivors located, the initial crisis response completed. Nepal's earthquake was already becoming a historical event, a thing that had happened and ended.

But in the winter of 2026, two years and two months later, families in Jajarkot and surrounding districts were living through something that policy documents had not named: the second winter. And it was becoming clear that earthquakes do not end when the tremors do.

The temporary shelters that had been erected in November 2023 were still standing. They were not supposed to still be standing. The plastic sheeting and wooden frames were meant to protect families for weeks, perhaps months, until reconstruction began. Instead, they had become permanent. Families had learned to accept the cold wind entering through gaps in the plastic. They had learned to manage the condensation that formed every night and fell on children as they slept. They had learned to accept that temporary was now permanent, that what was meant to last months would last years.

It was in these shelters, during the second winter, that a different kind of medical crisis emerged. It was not acute. It was not visible. It did not make international headlines. It was the slow accumulation of respiratory illness in populations without adequate housing, adequate heat, or adequate ventilation—and it was becoming the silent disaster that the immediate earthquake response had not anticipated.

The Nivaran Foundation's health workers in Jajarkot documented the pattern over three months in early 2026. Children in temporary shelters developed persistent coughs. Elderly people's chronic illnesses worsened. Pregnant women developed infections that ordinary housing would not have caused. The medical response was straightforward—antibiotics, cough medication, supportive care. But the root cause was not medical. It was architectural. Families were living in structures designed for weeks in shelters meant for temporary crisis. Winter turned those structures into factories for disease.

A mother who had come to a Nivaran clinic with her three children described the shelter: 'We have plastic on one side for rain, plastic on the other side for wind. Between them is where we sleep. When we heat the air, moisture makes everything wet. When we do not heat, we freeze.' She was not complaining. She was describing the architecture of chronic illness. Children living in that shelter developed pneumonia not because of bacterial virulence, but because their lungs were spending every night in environments that mimicked the conditions of a mild flood—damp, insufficient ventilation, impossible temperature regulation.

The second winter revealed something that post-disaster response systems still do not fully address: acute crisis responses and chronic stability responses are completely different systems. The acute response saves lives during the first weeks—rapid rescue, emergency shelter, immediate medical care. The chronic response prevents death during the months that follow—adequate housing, health care that addresses disease patterns created by temporary conditions, economic support that allows families to afford both transport to clinics and food to eat.

These are not the same thing. A system optimized for acute response—rapid deployment, emergency protocols, standardized interventions—fails when shifted to chronic conditions because chronic response requires exactly what acute systems do not have: flexibility, local adaptation, integration with household economics.

A father living in a temporary settlement articulated the impossible calculus that families faced: 'If we travel today, we eat less tomorrow.' This was not metaphorical. The family had calculated their resources. They knew what the cost of traveling to the health clinic would be. They also knew what their food budget was. The money used for transport—bus fare, meals during the journey, incidental expenses—was money not available for food that evening. In the context of survival economics, a respiratory infection in a child had to be weighed against hunger for the entire family. Many families chose to wait, hoping the infection would clear without treatment. Some waited too long.

What made the second winter different from the first winter after the earthquake was that families had now experienced two years of inadequate shelter. They were not in acute shock. They were not energized by aid organizations. They were exhausted. The initial mobilization of international resources had faded. The detailed attention that floods down during acute crises had moved to other disasters. Jajarkot was now a recovery context, which meant that the world had stopped watching, but families were still living in plastic shelters.

The Nivaran Foundation's response to the second winter was built on a recognition that post-earthquake health is not purely medical. It requires integrated planning across shelter, health care, and economic protection. The Foundation worked with district authorities to establish pre-positioned respiratory medications and diagnostic capacity at local clinics so that families did not have to choose between treatment and hunger. If a child developed pneumonia, they could be treated locally without transport costs that would consume the family's food budget.

Simultaneously, the Foundation coordinated with relief organizations still operating in the district to ensure that heating materials—fuel, stoves, ventilation supplies—were prioritized alongside medical response, recognizing that better shelter would prevent more illness than medical treatment could cure. And they integrated health planning with livelihoods programming so that families had economic capacity to afford both medical care and food.

The second winter in Jajarkot taught the Nivaran Foundation something that epidemiologists often miss: health crises do not end when the disease burden ends. They linger in the architecture of recovery, in the mathematics of household survival, in the impossible choices families have to make every day. Addressing them requires more than medicine. It requires a fundamental reimagining of what post-disaster health systems look like—not as a weeks-long sprint of emergency response, but as a years-long commitment to the conditions that allow people to be healthy.

The economic dimension of the second winter cannot be understated. Earthquake reconstruction funds, when they did arrive, were absorbed first by infrastructure—roads, government buildings, schools. Household housing reconstruction moved more slowly, its pace determined by individual family capacity to contribute labor and materials. Families with savings or remittance income rebuilt faster. Families without resources remained in temporary shelters longer. The correlation between economic status and shelter quality in the second winter was exact and cruel: those who could least afford prolonged temporary housing were those who endured it longest.

Community health workers who visited temporary settlements regularly documented what long-term temporary housing does to social fabric. People became withdrawn. The communal gatherings that had characterized pre-earthquake village life—festivals, agricultural cooperative work, shared meals—diminished as families retreated into the cramped isolation of their individual shelters. Social isolation compounded health risk: people were less likely to notice and respond to neighbors' medical emergencies. Communities lost the informal health surveillance that social connection provides.

The Nivaran Foundation's response required acknowledging something difficult: that the health crisis of the second winter was not primarily a healthcare problem. It was a housing problem. A governance problem. A reconstruction delay problem. Healthcare providers could treat respiratory infections when they developed, but they could not prevent them while families slept in plastic shelters. This boundary—between what healthcare can do and what governance must do—defines one of the most important lessons of post-disaster response. Health outcomes in the second winter will not improve until shelter improves. And shelter improvement requires not medical skill but political will and administrative capacity.
