Before sunrise in Jajarkot, the cold reaches the body before the light reaches the hills. In one temporary shelter, a mother warmed water over a small stove while her two children slept under thin layers of cloth. She told our team she had stopped counting nights since the earthquake. She now counts mornings without fever, mornings without cough, mornings when no one had to walk out in the dark looking for help.

This is what the second winter looks like in post-quake districts. Not one dramatic collapse, but daily exposure. Not one emergency siren, but repeated low-grade health stress that pushes families past their clinical margin. The earthquake made the damage visible. Winter makes its consequences biological.

On January 4, 2026, as temperatures remained low across quake-affected areas, many households were still living in temporary or semi-temporary structures. Plastic sheets, partial tarps, damaged roofs, and smoke-heavy indoor heating create the exact conditions where respiratory disease grows fastest. The public conversation often moves on when tremors stop. Illness does not.

<div className="section-divider"><span>Cold Exposure Is Clinical</span></div>

A tent can protect from rain for a while. It cannot replace thermal shelter in prolonged winter. In children, older adults, and people already undernourished, chronic cold exposure increases respiratory risk, weakens immune response, and raises the likelihood of complications from routine infections.

Pneumonia does not begin as a headline. It begins as a cough that does not settle, a child breathing faster than usual, a fever that returns at night, a delayed trip because transport costs too much. In remote terrain, delay is almost always part of the disease pathway.

Families in temporary shelters face three linked pressures at once:

In practice, this meant greater cold exposure because structures leak heat, greater indoor smoke exposure from emergency heating and cooking, and greater referral delay because households are financially and logistically exhausted.

Each pressure is manageable alone. Together, they create predictable harm.

<div className="section-divider"><span>What We Saw in the Field</span></div>

In ward-level outreach during the first week of January, we saw the same pattern repeatedly. Children with lingering cough and low appetite. Older adults reporting night breathlessness but delaying assessment because walking in cold mornings worsened symptoms. Caregivers stretching medicines by dose or by day because refills required travel they could not afford.

The health risk is not only infection. It is also treatment interruption. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and maternal recovery needs are less likely to maintain continuity when shelter, income, and movement are unstable at the same time.

One father in a settlement area said he now chooses between paying for transport and buying fuel. "If we travel today, we eat less tomorrow," he told us. That is the math of post-disaster winter for many families. Clinical advice is only actionable when household economics can carry it.

<div className="section-divider"><span>Why This Emergency Is Easy to Miss</span></div>

Post-disaster response systems are often strongest in the acute phase. Supplies arrive, teams mobilize, and urgent trauma care is prioritized. That phase is necessary. But medium-term winter risk receives less attention because it looks ordinary from a distance. A tent is still standing, so the situation appears stable. A family is still in place, so displacement is treated as managed.

What is invisible from outside is the accumulation inside. Cold nights, damp bedding, smoke-heavy air, delayed treatment, and interrupted nutrition do not produce one event. They produce a season of avoidable morbidity.

This is where health planning must change from event response to seasonal risk management. In mountain and hill districts, winter should be treated as a formal clinical season after disasters, with pre-defined prevention targets, follow-up schedules, and referral triggers.

<div className="section-divider"><span>What Nivaran Is Doing Now</span></div>

Our winter response in quake-affected districts focuses on prevention before escalation. That means field teams prioritize early respiratory screening, child symptom checks, maternal follow-up, and medicine continuity for chronic conditions.

Operationally, we are applying four immediate measures:

In practice, this meant localized respiratory screening days near temporary settlements, rapid referral triage for children and older adults with red-flag signs, household-level counseling on ventilation and safe heating behavior, and continuity support for basic medicines where travel barriers are acute.

These actions do not replace long-term reconstruction. They reduce preventable deterioration while reconstruction catches up.

We are also working with local health workers to shorten decision lag. Families often wait too long because symptoms appear manageable until they are not. Community-level triage support helps identify when "wait and see" becomes dangerous.

<div className="section-divider"><span>The Policy Gap</span></div>

Nepal has improved emergency response capacity in recent years, but post-disaster winter health planning remains uneven. Shelter policy, health policy, and social protection are still too often implemented in parallel instead of as one integrated winter strategy.

A household in temporary shelter does not experience these systems separately. Shelter quality determines exposure. Exposure determines illness risk. Illness risk determines health-seeking behavior. Health-seeking behavior is shaped by transport and cash.

If support arrives in disconnected parts, risk stays connected.

What should be standard in post-disaster winter districts:

In practice, this meant minimum thermal shelter benchmarks tied to health surveillance, pediatric respiratory tracking with ward-level follow-up, protected medicine continuity channels for chronic-care patients, and emergency transport support for high-risk maternal and child cases.

These are practical planning choices. They can be budgeted, measured, and corrected in-season.

<div className="section-divider"><span>What This Means for January</span></div>

The hardest part of the second winter is that it feels endless to families and temporary to everyone else. That mismatch creates policy fatigue while risk remains high. We need the opposite: operational persistence until winter risk falls.

For the next several weeks, the work is straightforward. Find symptoms early. Treat quickly. Reduce exposure where possible. Protect continuity for chronic patients. Keep referral routes active. Repeat.

Every one of these steps is less expensive than late-stage hospitalization. More importantly, every one of these steps keeps families out of crisis mode.

Jajarkot does not need sympathy messaging. It needs disciplined winter response until homes are safe, clinics are reachable, and illness no longer rides on weather.

This second winter should be remembered not as an afterthought, but as a test of whether recovery planning can protect life after cameras leave.

If you want to stand with these communities, stand with prevention now, while small symptoms are still small and before another avoidable emergency starts at midnight inside a temporary shelter.
