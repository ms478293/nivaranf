  Transforming Education Across Nepal
</h1>

Project Vidya is Nivaran Foundation's flagship education initiative, dedicated to ensuring every child in Nepal has access to quality learning opportunities. Education is one of Nivaran's two core pillars, alongside healthcare, and Project Vidya represents our commitment to breaking cycles of poverty through knowledge and skill development.

Building on Nivaran's proven track record across 52 districts in Nepal, Project Vidya addresses the systemic barriers to education: undertrained teachers, crumbling school infrastructure, lack of digital resources, and financial barriers that prevent students from completing their studies.
