A child is brought to a rural clinic in Nepal after a dog bite. The bite itself is not extensive or obviously severe. It is a puncture wound, an abrasion. The clinician's first concern, however, is not infection but the possibility of rabies—the disease that is almost invariably fatal once symptoms appear but is nearly 100 percent preventable with timely post-exposure prophylaxis.

The clinician's first action is not to diagnose or to treat, but to check the vaccine supply. The facility has run low on rabies vaccine. Perhaps they are completely out. The child has been bitten by a dog, and the facility cannot provide the life-saving vaccine that could prevent an almost certainly fatal disease. The incident transforms in an instant from a medical problem into a catastrophe of system failure.

Rabies is one of the most remarkable examples of a disease that should not exist in the modern world. The vaccine is nearly perfect. A person bitten by a potentially rabid animal who receives post-exposure prophylaxis has a survival rate greater than 99 percent. Yet globally, tens of thousands of people die of rabies each year, almost all of them in low-income countries, almost all of them children, almost all of them from preventable deaths. The deaths are not prevented because the vaccine is too expensive or too complex. They happen because the systems that distribute vaccine do not reach the people who need it.

The Nivaran Foundation's work with rabies prevention begins from the understanding that preventing rabies deaths is not primarily a technical challenge. It is a systems challenge. It is about ensuring that vaccine reaches facilities that serve remote populations. It is about training community members to recognize when a bite poses rabies risk. It is about creating pathways where someone bitten by an animal knows exactly what to do and where to go and what care will be available.

The foundation has worked on what might seem like the boring aspects of rabies prevention: supply chain management. Ensuring that vaccine is actually available at facilities that serve rural communities. Coordinating with government health systems to improve stock management. Working with communities to understand when rabies risk is present. Building referral pathways so that someone bitten in a remote area knows where the nearest reliable source of rabies vaccine is located.

This work has an almost unglamorous quality about it. There are no dramatic interventions. No surgeries. No high-tech diagnostic systems. Just the steady work of ensuring that a vaccine gets to where it is needed. Yet that unglamorous work is literally the difference between life and death for people in remote areas. A child bitten by a dog has maybe a day or two to receive post-exposure prophylaxis. Every hour matters. A vaccine that is even a day's travel away is too far away, because by the time the child receives it, neurological damage may have begun.

The foundation has also worked on training community members—parents, teachers, community health workers—to recognize rabies risk and respond appropriately. Any unprovoked bite from a wild animal should be considered rabies risk. Any bite from a dog of unknown vaccination status should be considered rabies risk. Anyone with these exposures needs immediate vaccination. But guidance is not enough. People need to know where to go. They need to know that vaccination will be available. They need to know that seeking care will not result in financial catastrophe. They need pathways that work in the real world.

What is most striking about rabies prevention in remote areas is how close we are to having solved the problem. The vaccine works. The treatment is understood. The barriers are not medical but logistical. Yet people continue to die from a disease we know how to prevent, largely because the systems that would make prevention accessible have not been adequately resourced or supported in rural areas.

This pattern—where the knowledge and tools to prevent a disease exist but the systems to deliver them do not—appears throughout the Nivaran Foundation's work. Leprosy is curable but people hide symptoms. Dialysis is available but people cannot reliably access it. Rabies is preventable but people die for lack of vaccine. In each case, the problem is not medical. It is systemic. It is about creating pathways and supply chains and communication networks that actually work in the real world. A child bitten by a dog should not have to worry that the vaccine needed to save their life will not be available. That is not an unreasonable expectation. Yet in remote Nepal, it is a genuine concern—and the reason is not that vaccine is scarce or expensive, but that the systems that deliver it have not been designed with rural access in mind.

The rabies situation in Nepal is in some ways more tractable than most neglected tropical diseases because the solutions are not primarily scientific—they are operational. The vaccine works. The treatment protocols are well-established. What is required is not research but delivery: ensuring that every health facility in a high-risk area has reliable vaccine stock, that every community health worker knows which bites are high-risk and what protocol to follow, and that every family in these communities knows what to do if they or a family member are bitten.

The Nivaran Foundation has been working to build exactly this delivery infrastructure in the districts where rabies risk is highest. Part of this work is direct service: positioning antivenom and vaccine at community-accessible points, training community health workers in bite risk assessment and post-exposure prophylaxis protocols, establishing communication pathways so that a family that experiences a high-risk bite at night knows who to call and what to expect. Part of it is advocacy: working with district health authorities to include rabies in routine health worker training, to include antivenom in essential medicine supply lists, and to track and report rabies-related mortality so that the burden becomes visible.

The ultimate measure of success in rabies prevention is not awareness or training rates—it is whether zero children die of rabies from a bite that happened within reach of available post-exposure prophylaxis. That is an achievable goal. Nepal has the vaccine. The knowledge exists. The question is whether the organizational commitment to ensure that every bite that should receive prophylaxis actually receives it will be sustained long enough to drive mortality to zero. The foundation will not rest until the answer is yes.
