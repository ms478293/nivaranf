The issue of ocular disorders among internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Benue State, Nigeria, represents a profound and often overlooked humanitarian crisis. It is a stark reminder that in our increasingly interconnected world, the phrase "Distance is the Disease" holds more truth than ever. For those uprooted by conflict and circumstance, geographic and systemic distances from adequate healthcare transform treatable conditions into debilitating impairments, locking individuals and communities into cycles of poverty and dependency.

A recent study published in Greener Journals, "The Prevalence of Ocular Disorders and Ease of Access to Eye Care Service among Internally Displaced Persons in Benue State" by Ilochi, O.N., casts a revealing light on this crisis. The findings are not merely statistics; they are a testament to the silent suffering of a population already burdened by displacement. With a staggering 62.5% prevalence of ocular disorders among the surveyed IDPs, this research underscores a public health emergency that demands immediate and strategic intervention.

The study's demographic breakdown offers crucial context. A slight majority of female participants (56.8%) aligns with global humanitarian data, which frequently shows women and children forming the largest proportion of displaced populations. This demographic reality carries significant implications for eye health planning, as women often face additional barriers to healthcare, including caregiving responsibilities, cultural norms, and limited autonomy in health decision-making. The predominance of young to middle-aged adults (18-39 years) among the IDPs, representing 66.4% of respondents, further highlights the economic and societal impact of vision loss. These are the individuals who are typically the most economically active, and their impaired vision can severely impede camp productivity, hinder rebuilding efforts, and contribute to long-term disability, thereby entrenching the cycle of poverty within these communities.

Education, or the lack thereof, emerges as a critical determinant. A distressing 35.1% of respondents reported no formal education, a figure significantly higher than national averages. This educational deficit is a direct consequence of conflict disrupting schooling and destroying infrastructure, but its repercussions extend far beyond literacy. Low health literacy directly correlates with a reduced understanding of preventive health practices and limited awareness of available services, effectively closing off avenues for care even when they might exist. This gap is not merely academic; it is a chasm that swallows opportunities for health and well-being.

Economically, the situation is dire. More than half of the respondents (55.6%) earned less than ₦10,000 monthly, placing them firmly below the extreme poverty line. This level of destitution, exacerbated by displacement, means that even nominally low-cost health interventions are often beyond reach. The implication is unambiguous: for any eye care initiative to be effective in these settings, it must be entirely free or heavily subsidized. The market-driven model of healthcare, so often championed, simply fails in contexts of such extreme vulnerability.

The prevalence of ocular disorders among these IDPs, at 62.5%, is alarmingly high, dramatically exceeding the rates found in the general Nigerian population. This disparity is not accidental; it is a direct consequence of the abysmal living conditions prevalent in IDP camps. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate access to clean water create fertile ground for infectious eye diseases like conjunctivitis and trachoma. The chronic stress, inadequate nutrition leading to vitamin deficiencies (particularly Vitamin A, crucial for eye health), and limited access to basic healthcare services create a perfect storm for visual impairment. These are not merely health issues; they are humanitarian failures.

Specific conditions paint an even more vivid picture of neglect. Refractive errors were the most common disorder, affecting 24.3% of respondents. These are conditions that, in developed nations, are easily corrected with spectacles. Yet, for IDPs, uncorrected refractive errors lead to significant visual impairment, impacting every aspect of daily life from education to livelihood. Cataracts, affecting 16.2%, are another leading cause of preventable blindness globally. In the IDP context, prolonged exposure to UV radiation due to inadequate shelter, coupled with a lack of surgical interventions, allows these conditions to progress unchecked, stealing sight from individuals who can ill afford to lose it. Conjunctivitis, at 12%, speaks volumes about the unsanitary and overcrowded environments, where infectious diseases spread rapidly. The presence of suspected glaucoma and corneal scarring, though less frequent, points to severe, often irreversible, vision loss that could have been prevented with early diagnosis and intervention.

Perhaps the most troubling finding is the critically low utilization of eye care services: only 30.1% of IDPs reported having accessed any form of eye care. This figure is not just low; it is a condemnation of the existing humanitarian response mechanisms. It signifies that the vast majority of ocular disorders among IDPs remain undiagnosed and untreated, leading to increased disability, diminished quality of life, and prolonged socioeconomic dependency.

The barriers to access are manifold, but financial hardship stands as the most formidable, cited by 60.2% of respondents. This is compounded by the sheer physical "distance" to care—the absence of nearby clinics (44.8%), lack of awareness of where to go (36.5%), and absence of transportation (29.3%). These are not isolated problems; they form an interlocking web of obstacles that effectively isolates IDPs from the care they desperately need. The concept of "Distance is the Disease" is manifest here, not just in kilometers, but in the economic, informational, and infrastructural gaps that separate vulnerable individuals from health solutions. Fear of treatment and long waiting times also play a role, highlighting the psychological and systemic challenges within these temporary healthcare provisions.

The study’s implications are clear and urgent. The integration of comprehensive eye health services into the primary healthcare systems of displaced populations is not merely a recommendation; it is an imperative. This must include routine vision screening, the provision of affordable or free corrective lenses, and, crucially, surgical services for cataracts. Treatment for infections and long-term management of chronic conditions like glaucoma must also be prioritized. These interventions are not luxuries; they are fundamental human rights and essential components of restoring dignity, fostering self-reliance, and enabling displaced individuals to contribute meaningfully to their communities.

In conclusion, the ocular health crisis among IDPs in Benue State is a microcosm of a larger global challenge. It demonstrates how displacement, poverty, and systemic neglect combine to create profound health inequalities. The findings of Ilochi's study serve as a powerful call to action, urging us to bridge the distances—be they geographical, financial, educational, or emotional—that continue to define the health outcomes of the world's most vulnerable. We must recognize that investing in their sight is investing in their future, and by extension, in a more just and equitable world. This is not merely a medical necessity; it is a moral imperative that resonates with the core values of Nivaran: to alleviate suffering and empower those in need, ensuring that distance no longer dictates destiny.
