At the international airport, travelers pass through sophisticated screening procedures. Temperature checks, health declarations, observation for symptoms. Resources are invested in surveillance at this highly visible point of entry, creating the appearance of epidemic preparedness. Yet simultaneously, in the same country, people are crossing borders through unmapped land routes—informal corridors that handle more traffic than the airport but operate almost entirely outside official surveillance systems.

This image captures the fundamental problem that the Nivaran Foundation identified in its analysis of public health preparedness: health surveillance infrastructure is often oriented toward what is visible and formal, while neglecting what is actually consequential and likely to serve as a pathway for disease transmission.

The critique is not that airport screening is wrong. International travel should be monitored. But the critique is that limited resources are allocated to visible, formalized infrastructure while being largely neglected from the informal pathways that actually move the bulk of cross-border traffic. The result is a false sense of security: we screen the sky—the airplane passengers—while ignoring the ground—the informal crossings where far more people move.

In the remote border regions where Nivaran Foundation works, the informal crossings are not anomalies or rare events. They are how most people move between countries. They are where trade happens. They are where family networks cross borders. They are where disease actually circulates. Yet these movements are largely invisible to formal health surveillance systems. A person carrying an infectious disease can cross the border and enter a community without any public health system having any awareness that the transmission chain has just jumped boundaries.

The Foundation's approach has been to work with local communities living in these high-traffic informal corridors to develop community-level surveillance systems. Rather than trying to establish formal checkpoints—something neither feasible nor desirable in areas where borders are porous and informal movement is essential to community livelihoods—Nivaran has worked to build systems where community members themselves become part of disease surveillance. If someone in a household shows symptoms of a communicable disease, particularly during seasonal periods when epidemics are most likely, there is a pathway for reporting, a connection to formal health services, a way to alert health authorities that a disease signal has emerged.

This approach requires building community trust and engagement in ways that formal surveillance never could. People will not report their symptoms to systems they do not trust. They will not share information with authorities they believe will penalize them. So the work must begin with building relationships and demonstrating that reporting disease signals leads not to punishment but to care, not to quarantine and exclusion but to treatment and support.

What makes this work different from traditional surveillance is that it begins from the assumption that people in remote areas are not problems to be managed or controlled, but partners in disease prevention. It recognizes that communities already have disease surveillance systems—informal, undocumented, but real. Grandmothers know when a disease is circulating. Community elders understand seasons when particular illnesses are likely. The work is to connect these existing knowledge systems to formal health services.

This requires institutional humility—recognizing that formal systems do not have a monopoly on useful information, that community members see things that official surveillance systems miss, that ground-level knowledge is epidemiologically important. It requires respecting the constraints that communities face—the reality that people cannot be expected to travel far for care or to invest large amounts of time in health-seeking when they are living in economic precarity.

The aviation analogy remains instructive. We screen the sky because airplane travel is visible and governments have jurisdiction over airports. But we largely ignore the ground because informal movement is harder to control and harder to monitor. Yet from a disease-transmission perspective, the ground is far more important. Which surveillance system you invest in reveals your priorities, and the current allocation of resources to formal, visible systems while ignoring informal, ground-level transmission pathways suggests that governments are more interested in the appearance of preparedness than in the reality of disease control.

The Nivaran Foundation's work suggests an alternative: build preparedness systems that acknowledge how disease actually spreads, invest in surveillance at the points of actual transmission rather than at the points of formal entry, engage communities as partners in disease detection, and build pathways for care that reflect the real constraints and circumstances that people face. This will never be as visible as a sophisticated airport screening system. But it will be more effective, more equitable, and more likely to actually prevent disease when it matters most.

The Nivaran Foundation's community-based surveillance model has generated a finding that challenges conventional thinking about disease surveillance cost-effectiveness. The conventional assumption is that community-based surveillance is expensive and inefficient compared to centralized systems—that it is better to concentrate surveillance resources in formal facilities where they can be applied systematically. But the foundation's data shows the opposite: community-based surveillance detects outbreaks earlier, more completely, and at lower total system cost than facility-based surveillance alone, particularly in areas where informal crossing is common.

The reason is simple: community members encounter disease before health facilities do. A grandmother who notices that three households in her village have similar fever and rash symptoms will notice this days before any of those households seek care at a formal facility. If that grandmother has a mechanism to report what she observes—a trusted community health worker who listens, a phone number that reaches district health, a community meeting where health concerns are regularly discussed—the detection happens earlier. Earlier detection means earlier response, which means smaller outbreaks, which means lower total disease burden and lower total response cost.

This evidence should change how health systems allocate surveillance resources. The investment in formal point-of-entry screening is not wrong. But it is insufficient without parallel investment in community-level surveillance that can detect disease where it actually first appears—in homes, in informal crossing points, in the social networks of border communities. The sky matters. But the ground is where disease lives. And until surveillance systems treat the ground with the same systematic attention they give to the sky, they will continue to miss outbreaks until they are already difficult to contain.
