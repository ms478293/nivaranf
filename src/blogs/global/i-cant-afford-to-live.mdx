A man in a Terai district receives a diagnosis that will define the rest of his economic life as much as his physical life. He has diabetes and hypertension. He is forty-three years old. He has thirty or forty years of living ahead of him, if he manages these conditions well. But managing them requires medication, regular monitoring, and lifestyle adjustments that cost money every single month for the rest of his life. He earns approximately twelve thousand rupees a month as a day laborer. The estimated monthly cost of managing his conditions adequately—medications, glucose monitoring, consultations, transport—is three to four thousand rupees.

This is twenty-five to thirty percent of his household income. Spent every month. Without end. For the rest of his life.

'I cannot afford to live,' he told a Nivaran Foundation health worker during a follow-up visit. He was not being dramatic. He was doing arithmetic. He had calculated precisely what his survival would cost, and he had determined that it was not sustainable on his current income. Some months he would buy the medication. Other months, the household would need that money for food. He would skip doses. His blood glucose would spike. His blood pressure would climb. He would gradually accumulate the damage that comes from inadequately controlled chronic disease: neuropathy, kidney failure, cardiovascular events.

Chronic disease in low-income settings creates a particular form of poverty trap. Unlike an acute illness that demands resources in a single intense period and then concludes, chronic diseases demand a steady monthly economic commitment indefinitely. They transform the household's economic planning from managing a crisis into living permanently with a financial drain. They require trade-offs between health investment and other necessities—food, school fees, housing, social obligations—every single month.

The Nivaran Foundation's research on chronic disease burden documents this trap in detail. In their working areas, the households most severely affected by chronic disease show distinct economic trajectories: assets sold to pay for treatment, children withdrawn from school to reduce expenses, productive adults reducing work hours due to illness while simultaneously needing to earn more for treatment costs. The illness creates the economic stress, and the economic stress makes managing the illness harder, and the poorly managed illness progresses further, and the progression creates greater economic stress.

What makes this particularly cruel is that it is largely preventable—not the chronic disease itself, necessarily, though prevention of diabetes and hypertension is possible with lifestyle interventions—but the economic devastation that follows from it. In health systems with adequate social protection, chronic disease is expensive but manageable. Medications are subsidized. Regular monitoring is covered. The monthly cost to the individual patient is controlled. The illness does not translate directly into economic catastrophe.

In Nepal's rural areas, that social protection largely does not exist. Medications may be subsidized at government facilities, but government facilities may be far from where patients live. Transport costs to access subsidized medication can eliminate the savings from the subsidy. Generic medications that are nominally available may be out of stock for weeks or months. Patients who cannot plan reliably on medication availability buy from private pharmacies at market prices, paying the full cost.

The Nivaran Foundation's response has focused on several levels. At the clinical level, they have worked to ensure more consistent medication availability in communities where chronic disease is prevalent—pre-positioning supplies, reducing the frequency of journeys required for refills, training community health workers to monitor and support chronic disease management without requiring repeated facility visits.

At the system level, they have advocated for improvements in social protection mechanisms: better subsidization of essential chronic disease medications, transport support for patients who need to access care regularly, and the extension of health insurance coverage to low-income populations who currently cannot afford premiums.

At the community level, they have worked on chronic disease groups—bringing together people managing similar conditions to share experiences, support each other, and collectively navigate the economic and clinical challenges. These groups reduce the isolation of managing chronic disease and create peer support networks that help people maintain treatment adherence even when resources are constrained.

The man who told a Nivaran health worker that he cannot afford to live is not exceptional. He represents a pattern that the foundation has documented across hundreds of households: people who understand their diagnosis, understand what their treatment requires, and make rational decisions to skip doses or delay refills because they cannot sustainably allocate twenty-five percent of their income to medication every month. His solution—partial treatment that keeps him alive but allows disease to progress—is not a failure of his character or willpower. It is a rational response to an impossible financial situation. Changing that situation requires changing systems, not blaming individuals.

The Nivaran Foundation has begun working on what it terms 'chronic disease economic navigators'—community health workers trained not just in chronic disease clinical management but in helping patients navigate the economic dimensions of chronic illness. These navigators help patients identify which government subsidies they qualify for, how to access health insurance schemes, how to negotiate with pharmacies for generic alternatives to branded medications, and how to organize their medical care to minimize transport costs through batching multiple care needs into single visits.

The navigator role recognizes a truth that clinical training rarely acknowledges: the economic management of chronic illness requires as much skill and knowledge as the clinical management. A patient who understands what his medications do but does not know how to afford them will not take them. A patient who knows he should have quarterly blood tests but cannot plan the transport costs will skip them. The clinical knowledge and the economic knowledge must both be present for treatment to actually happen.

The patients who are told they cannot afford to live deserve a health system that takes seriously what living costs and designs support around those costs. Not as charity but as the practical acknowledgment that a medication that exists but cannot be afforded is, for that patient, no different from a medication that does not exist. Making treatment affordable, accessible, and economically survivable is as much a clinical obligation as making it technically effective. The man who told his health worker he cannot afford to live deserves a health system that responds not with platitudes about the importance of adherence but with concrete support that makes adherence possible.
