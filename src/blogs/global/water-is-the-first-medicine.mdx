In a clinic in a densely populated neighborhood of Kathmandu, a health worker named Maya attempted to explain to a mother why boiling water before using it to clean her child's infected wound was important. The mother's face showed the familiar expression of someone trying to comply with instructions that made no practical sense. The challenge was straightforward: the mother had no reliable access to water during the times when she had the time to boil it. The Melamchi water supply disruptions that began in January 2026 had made water access even more unpredictable. When water did arrive, she used it immediately for basic needs.

'I understand that water should be clean,' the mother said, not defensively but with a kind of resignation. 'But I do not have clean water. I use what comes from the tap.' This is the central problem that Nivaran Foundation has been trying to address: in a system where households lack reliable clean water access, clinical advice that assumes clean water becomes not helpful guidance but impossible demands.

The mother's child's infection was progressing. The wound was not healing. The most likely explanation was that contaminated water was perpetuating the infection. The clinical solution—use clean water for wound care—was technically correct but contextually impossible.

Nivaran conducted detailed household water audits in several neighborhoods, documenting exactly how much water families had access to, when it arrived, what they used it for, and what health behaviors required water but were being compromised by scarcity. The findings were stark: households averaged two to three hours of water availability per day, often unpredictably timed. This water had to cover cooking, drinking, bathing, laundry, and any other water-dependent needs. In a household with children or elderly people, water would be systematically allocated—basic drinking and cooking first, hygiene second, everything else third.

Wound care—cleaning a wound with boiled water multiple times daily—required water that most households simply did not have.

Nivaran's approach moved beyond telling families to boil water. Instead, the organization worked to understand what was actually possible given real water constraints, and then designed guidance around that reality. 'We asked families: if you have a wound, and you have limited water, how would you prioritize its use?' a health educator, Deepak, explained. 'They said drinking first, food preparation second, wound care if something was left. So we asked: how can we support wound healing without overwhelming your water-dependent decisions?'

The intervention included practical guidance on wound care that accounts for water scarcity—using the clearest water available rather than insisting on boiled water, or cleaning wounds less frequently but more thoroughly. It included connection to water supply information so families with knowledge of Melamchi supply schedules could better plan when water-requiring health behaviors could occur. And it included connection to water improvement initiatives.

Anjali had a child with an infected wound from a fall. She had received standard wound care advice initially: clean the wound twice daily with boiled water, keep it covered, watch for signs of infection. She had tried to follow the advice, but her household's water access made it impossible. When Nivaran's health worker visited, the conversation was different. 'How much water can you actually use for wound care? When does water arrive at your house? What could you realistically do?'

Anjali explained that water arrived for about an hour in early morning and an hour in early evening. During that time, she prioritized cooking and drinking water. She had perhaps a liter left. 'In that case,' the worker said, 'let us use that water strategically. Clean the wound once daily when water is available, using the water you have. Keep it covered between cleanings. Watch these specific signs—fever, increasing redness spreading up the limb, pus with a bad smell. If you see those signs, come to clinic immediately.' The child's wound healed without serious infection, though more slowly than would have been ideal with optimal water access.

What Nivaran's research revealed was that many health problems in water-insecure areas develop not because families do not want to follow health advice, but because the advice assumes water availability that does not exist. Diarrheal diseases persist because handwashing water is scarce. Respiratory infections progress because families cannot clean living spaces adequately. Skin infections develop because bathing water is limited. Treating these problems requires not just clinical management but honest acknowledgment of water insecurity as the root cause.

The January 2026 Melamchi supply disruptions provided stark evidence: health facilities without adequate water had to limit services. Households without water used alternative sources—often contaminated—increasing diarrheal illness. Wound infections increased. Newborn infections increased.

Anjali, reflecting on her experience, said: 'The health worker's advice made sense. She did not pretend my life was different than it is. She helped me work within what I actually have. But the real need is water. Clean water, available when I need it. Until that happens, every family in this neighborhood will be managing health problems caused by water insecurity.' Nivaran's director stated it clearly: 'You cannot have good health outcomes in a water-insecure community, no matter how good your clinics are.'

The water security challenge in Kathmandu extends beyond individual household access to a systemic failure in urban infrastructure governance. The Melamchi water supply project—a major infrastructure initiative designed to improve water availability in the Kathmandu Valley—has been marked by delays, management failures, and reliability problems that have left large portions of the city's population with unreliable access for extended periods. When infrastructure systems fail in cities, the burden is not distributed equally. Wealthier households have storage capacity—tanks, reservoirs—that buffer them against supply interruptions. Poor households, with no storage capacity, experience every supply interruption as an immediate crisis.

The Nivaran Foundation's documentation of health impacts during the January 2026 Melamchi supply disruptions revealed something that infrastructure planners rarely acknowledge: the health cost of water supply failure is substantial and measurable in real time. The foundation tracked clinic visits for water-related illness during the disruption period and compared them to comparable periods in previous years with more reliable supply. The increase in diarrheal illness, skin infections, and wound complications during the disruption period was statistically significant and clinically important. These are not hypothetical future risks. They are actual current harms, documented and attributable to infrastructure failure.

What this means for health advocacy is that healthcare organizations like the Nivaran Foundation cannot limit themselves to clinical interventions. When the primary determinant of a patient's health outcome is infrastructure—water supply, road quality, electricity reliability—healthcare organizations must engage with infrastructure policy. Not as an incidental concern but as a core health equity issue. The health worker who can prescribe antibiotics for a wound infection but cannot ensure that the patient has clean water to clean the wound is working with one hand tied behind her back. Full health advocacy requires full engagement with the conditions that determine whether clinical care can succeed.
